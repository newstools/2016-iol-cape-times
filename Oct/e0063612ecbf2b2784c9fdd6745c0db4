HUNDREDS of women gathered at the Masjidul-Quds in Gatesville, Cape Town, yesterday dressed in pink hijabs as part of an awareness campaign in the Muslim community during the last week of Breast Cancer Month.The Pink Hijab Day, held every year for the past four years, is aimed at women fighting cancer and the survivors of this disease.It also gives a platform to exchange knowledge and educate the community.Mariam Kajig, 61, was diagnosed with cancer 24 years ago while she was six months pregnant with her only child.She said: &#x201C;It was a normal day and I was taking a shower when I felt a lump in my breast&#x201D;. Kajig went to a doctor who confirmed that she had &#x201C;99.9 percent breast cancer&#x201D;.She had a mastectomy when her son was born and 6 months later doctors found another cancer cell in her right breast, which also had to be removed, after which she started chemotherapy.Kajig added how important it was to have the support of family and loved ones.Her late father motivated and became her &#x201C;guiding force&#x201D; as she battled the cancer and endured chemotherapy.&#x201C;In order to survive cancer you must accept it, speak about it and half the battle is won.&#x201D;Myra America, 62, was diagnosed last June and had a mastectomy the same month.Today she&#x2019;s a co-ordinator for Cancer Association of South Africa, visiting communities and providing knowledge and support to those suffering from the disease.Faaika Agherdien said: &#x201C;Pink Hijab Day is a good initiative to create cancer awareness.&#x201D;
