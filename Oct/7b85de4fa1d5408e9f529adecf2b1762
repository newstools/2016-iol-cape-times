PHILIPPI residents took to the streets yesterday over the escalation in crime directed at women in the area, where police say more than 60 cases of rape get reported every month.The march ended at Philippi East police station after a memorandum of grievances and demands was handed to station commander Sandile Sonjani.The march was preceded by candle lighting in commemoration of rape victims, which was organised by civil society organisations, community safety, faith-based and local authorities.About 70 residents gathered at the Philippi Small Businesses premises and marched to the police station.Philippi Neighbourhood Watch deputy chairperson Babalwa Yelani said they gather the evidence for the police and hand cases over for investigations, but not a single case has been solved.&#x201C;For example, last week we established that a man was raping his five-year-old stepdaughter. The angry residents beat him up.&quot;But we as the neighbourhood called the police. The police took him to Gugulethu hospital. He is still on the run because the police did not guard him. That is how incompetent they are.&#x201D;She said rape has become so prevalent in the area that a woman was raped at any time.&#x201C;Women are raped while going to work here. They are raped in broad daylight. Not to mention at night when they are coming out of shebeens.&#x201D;Accepting the memorandum, Sonjani said: &#x201C;We must work together to stop this notion that women are our scapegoats.&#x201D;He said they were committed to work with the community and bring rapists to book. Sonjani urged the community to stop withdrawing cases and follow them through to the end.&#x201C;Withdrawing cases creates a vicious cycle as it gives the perpetrator another chance to recommit the same crime. Together we can arrest these perpetrators.&quot;The fact that you are here with these grievances and demands show you are serious. Let&apos;s work together to root out crime in our area,&#x201D; he said.Miss Commonwealth South Africa finalist Andisiwe Magingxa, who hails from the area, has demanded that the police arrest all perpetrators and fully investigate cases.&#x201C;That will result in the &#x2028;successful sentencing of those who commit these crimes. We pledge our support to work with the police to fight against these crimes,&#x201D; she said.Magingxa urged residents to come forward with information that could lead to arrests.&#x201C;Report these crimes. If you do not have the courage, talk to social workers and NGOs, who will assist you.&#x201D; [email&#160;protected]
