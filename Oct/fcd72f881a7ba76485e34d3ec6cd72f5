PRETORIA: When the new public protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, arrived at work on Monday to take over from Thuli Madonsela, she noticed that staff morale was low.Mkhwebane revealed this during her first media briefing yesterday since taking over as public protector.Issues affecting staff related to the performance management and development system, as well as the occupation-specific dispensation, she explained.&#x201C;These relate to the signing of performance agreements and assessing and incentivising performance, as well as the plight of senior investigative staff that are discontented about the implementation of occupation-specific dispensation, which has led to a &#x2028;situation where they earn &#x2028;less than their juniors,&#x201D; she said.She said senior investigative staff members declared a dispute at the CCMA for recourse. Prominent in the changes on the cards was the titling of the investigation reports to avoid unnecessary tension between the office and the state.Mkhwebane said the writing of the reports titles in full would assist students and &#x2028;academics to go back to the report to refer to it.She was set to establish a backlog project team to focus on the disposing of all cases older than two years.There was a backlog of a total of 260 cases older than two years under the good governance and integrity branch and 47 under administrative justice and service delivery.
