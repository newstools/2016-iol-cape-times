WITH the beach season on our doorstep and beachgoers expected to flood Cape Town&#x2019;s beaches this summer, the City has launched a Shark Spotters mobile application aimed at enhancing beach safety.The Shark Spotters mobile app provides water-users with current and accurate shark safety information on their smartphones so they can make informed decisions about shark risks, even before arriving at the beach.Unique and innovative, the app will assist swimmers and surfers to be more shark-smart at beaches, said Mayco member for energy, environmental and spatial planning Johan van der Merwe.The app is available on iOS and Android For more information, residents should contact Sarah Waries, the Shark Spotter Project Manager, on 078 174 4244.
