The allegations reportedly made by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas in an affidavit submitted to former public protector Thuli Madonsela relating to her investigation into &#x201C;state capture&#x201D; must be investigated by the Hawks, the DA said on Sunday.The deputy minister reportedly claimed that Ajay Gupta &#x2013; in the presence of President Jacob Zuma&#x2019;s son Duduzane and controversial businessman Fana Hlongwane &#x2013; offered him R600 000 in cash and a further R600 million to be paid in instalments in return for supporting the nuclear build programme at a meeting which took place on October 23, 2015 at the Guptas&#x2019; Saxonwold compound in Johannesburg, DA spokesman David Maynier said.The allegations provided more detail about what took place at the meeting where the deputy minister was allegedly offered the finance minister&#x2019;s job, and amounted to further prima facie evidence of corruption in terms of the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act, he said.&#x201C;An investigation by the Hawks (CAS 1200/3/2016) is already under way into this matter, following charges of corruption laid by myself against Atul Gupta, Ajay Gupta, and Duduzane Zuma, in terms of the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act (No 12 of 2004) on 17 March 2016 at a police station in Cape Town.&#x201C;And I will, therefore confirm, via a parliamentary question that the information, reportedly submitted to the public protector as part of her investigation into state capture has been submitted for investigation to the Hawks,&#x201D; Maynier said.The Sunday Times reported that Ajay Gupta allegedly offered Jonas R600 000 in cash in a black plastic bag at his family compound in Johannesburg, on the day he offered Jonas the job of finance minister.Gupta also allegedly promised Jonas a further R600 million to be paid in instalments if he agreed to &#x201C;work with us&#x201D;.The claim was believed to be contained in Jonas&#x2019;s affidavit submitted to Madonsela as evidence during her state capture investigation. Sources close to the probe said Jonas claimed in his affidavit that &#x201C;work with us&#x201D; meant he was expected to push for the approval of the nuclear procurement programme, estimated to be worth R1 trillion, and fire some National Treasury officials who were critical of the programme, the newspaper reported.The sources said Jonas confirmed in the affidavit that the Gupta brother offered him then finance minister Nhlanhla Nene&#x2019;s job during their meeting in Saxonwold on October 23 last year. This was just six weeks before Zuma fired Nene on December 9, replacing him with Des van Rooyen.The Sunday Times confirmed that telephone records would show that Van Rooyen visited the Gupta compound the night before he was appointed. &#x2013; African News Agency
