THE &#x201C;transformation of self first&#x201D; will be a key topic of discussion by Professor Shirley Zinn at next week&#x2019;s Cape Times Breakfast.The author, businessperson and academic will speak about her book Swimming Upstream, and her formula that hard work plus excellence plus fun equals success.Zinn said her book tells a story that inspires hope despite adversity, especially for the youth.&#x201C;The book speaks about pushing against conventional wisdom, a path less taken.&#x201C;You can do far more than you think &#x2013; and then you have the potential to do so much more,&#x201D; said Zinn.She said she believes in empowering people, especially the young, and she quoted &#x2028;Nelson Mandela: &#x201C;It seems impossible until it&#x2019;s done.&#x201D;The author knows one or two things about conquering seemingly impossible odds.Growing up in Steenberg on the Cape Flats, she liberated herself with the encouragement of her parents, and South Peninsula High School matric teachers Brian Isaacs and Riyaadh Najaar.She obtained her Master&#x2019;s degree in higher education from the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and Harvard, and went on to serve as a director at top South African banks and other institutions.Zinn is now the chief executive of her own human resources company.The breakfast will be served at the Alhambra Restaurant in Islamia College, Lansdowne, on October 27 at 8am and costs R180 a person.To book, e-mail [email&#160;protected] or call 021&#x2005;488&#x2005;4465.[email&#160;protected]
