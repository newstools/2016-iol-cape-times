The State is opposing bail in the case involving farm owner Martin Visser who allegedly murdered his employee in Lutzville in the West Coast Municipality.Visser, 42, has been charged with murder and assault with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm over the death of Adam Pieterse, 32.Pieterse&#x2019;s decomposing remains were found in a shallow grave last year.National Prosecuting Authority&#x2019;s Eric Ntabazalila, said Pieterse once laid a case of assault with intention to cause grievous bodily harm against Visser, but withdrew it.Lutzville community activist Billy Claasen said police were unhelpful and the station commander dropped the phone his ear when he once called to check on the progress of the investigation.Claasen said he made contact with the police&#x2019;s provincial office and former acting deputy provincial commissioner Jeremy Vearey, who assigned a team of detectives to the case.The court will on Thursday morning hear Visser&#x2019;s bail information, and the matter is expected to be postponed for a bail application.
