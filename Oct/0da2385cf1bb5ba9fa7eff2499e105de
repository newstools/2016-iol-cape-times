Banting advocate professor Tim Noakes came under fire on Thursday morning for not directing a mother seeking health advice on Twitter, to a doctor.Noakes, who has 77 000 Twitter followers, is defending himself at Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) inquiry into his professional conduct after he advised Pippa Leenstra on Tiwtter to wean her baby onto a low-carb, high-fat diet (LCHF).The tweet spurred over 500 responses.During heated exchanges at the inquiry, HPCSA advocate Ajay Bhoopchand asked Noakes if it was not his responsibility to direct Leenstra to more information about a proper LCHF diet for her child, apart from his single tweet.&#x201C;My job is to give information and allow the person to make a decision. It is her responsibility, not mine, to bring up that child,&#x201D; Noakes said, adding that Leenstra did not contact him through other means to acquire additional information, but instead chose to take the advice of other experts who weighed in on the social media debate.He again contended that this was the nature of Twitter, and users would benefit from information provided to them from various sources.
