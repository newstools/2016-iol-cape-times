UCT has been granted an interim court interdict which prohibits&#x2028;students from protesting on its campuses to help salvage its academic year.The university&#x2019;s management filed an urgent application for an interim interdict against protests on its campuses yesterday.Western Cape High Court judge Yasmin Meer said she was satisfied about the grounds made to issue the interim interdict.&#x201C;It must be said the concerns and goals of the students at UCT and indeed the rest of the country are legitimate. However, these concerns cannot justify the disquieting and disturbing means employed in pursuit of those goals.&#x201D;On granting the interdict, the judge said she hopes it helps salvage UCT&apos;s academic year and brings peace to its campuses.UCT advocate SP Rosenberg said the interdict was not against any group or individual, but would be applied as a blanket ban.Several marches are planned for today ahead of Finance Minister Pravin Godhan&#x2019;s much-anticipated medium-term budget policy speech.While the UCT Collective Unions, CPUT Central SRC and FMF movement were yet to be granted permission yesterday, the DA and the South African Faith Commission Environment Institute received the green light.UCT, CPUT, UWC and Stellenbosch University student protesters and workers called on their academics, civil society, religious and social organisations, including parents, to join their march.City spokesperson Priya Reddy said the UCT and CPUT groups were awaiting final approval from the chief magistrate.&#x201C;South African Police Service is the lead agent with regard to special security arrangements, but the City&#x2019;s enforcement agencies will play a supporting role if called upon to do so.&#x201D;City law enforcement director Robbie Roberts said: &#x201C;In light of the protests we suggest avoiding the streets surrounding Parliament as protests will start from 10am and could continue up until after 4pm.&quot;Student protests will start to commence from 10am at the St Mary&#x2019;s Cathedral and at 10.30am at Keizergracht, and we anticipate a large number.&#x201D;
