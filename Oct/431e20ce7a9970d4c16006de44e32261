INFIGHTING within the ANC Youth League over who will be the party&#x2019;s next deputy president has seen the league&#x2019;s provincial secretary, Andile Mbali, being served with a 15-day suspension letter, pending an investigation.But Mbali laughed it off, saying he was still the league&#x2019;s provincial secretary and would go ahead with his usual tasks despite facing the axe.The ANCYL is split over whether to support Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane or Mpumalanga &#x2028;Premier David &#x201C;DD&#x201D; Mabuza.What complicates matters is that Mabuza is part of the &#x201C;Premier League&#x201D; faction of the ANC, who are allies of President Jacob Zuma, while Mokonyane is also viewed as a Zuma ally.According to a source in the ANCYL, Mbali sent out a &#x2028;letter to members of the league&#x2019;s provincial executive, stating they should not attend a league meeting &#x201C;even after he had sent his apologies&#x201D;.The meeting, which was held in Hawston, &#x201C;quorated&#x201D; &#x2013; meaning the required number of provincial working committee (50%+1) members were present.Mbali&#x2019;s deputy, Marissa van Rensburg, said she gave notice because of his temporary suspension and for the letter he sent to the provincial executive members on October 13, &#x201C;which is a grave offence and undermines a fully constituted provincial working committee meeting, which he had termed illegal&#x201D;.Van Rensburg said the decisions made in the Hawston meeting were &#x201C;fully constitutional&#x201D;.&#x201C;The letter was sowing &#x2028;divisions and the letter to call for his temporary suspension came from an ANCYL provincial executive meeting on October 16 in Worcester.&#x201D;Mbali said the first time he saw the letter was yesterday, when it was e-mailed to him.&#x201C;I received it and I responded that I can&#x2019;t be suspended by my deputy.&#x201D;According to him, the decision to suspend him was taken at &#x201C;some picnic, where decisions were taken&#x201D;.&#x201C;I understand why some people would want me out. &#x2028;I refuse to be captured by old people (in the ANC).&#x201D;More than a year away from the ANC&#x2019;s elective conference, Mbali said there were party &#x2028;leaders in the Western Cape and nationally who were already trying to influence members of the youth league.&#x201C;Some of these ANCYL leaders are owned by people in the ANC, I&#x2019;m not one of them.&#x201D;
