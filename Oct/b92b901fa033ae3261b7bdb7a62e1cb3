UCT student Nosisa Ndabandaba has been announced the regional winner for the Western Cape in the Business Partners/SME Toolkit SA business plan competition.The teenager won several awards at the ceremony, including the Young Aspiring Entrepreneur certificate and a mentorship amount of R6&#xA0;000. Her business Supriim Vegan (Pty) Ltd, which provides healthy food, was among 99 business plans competed.&#x201C;I am very excited because one doesn&apos;t expect to win in a competition. In reality I worked hard for this competition,&#x201D; said Ndabandaba.The 19-year-old&#x2019;s aim is to revolutionise the food people eat every day, especially away from home.&quot;I want people to eat food without worrying about putting their health at risk by providing quality snacks that are free of gluten.&quot;Who doesn&apos;t love the feeling of getting to cheat a little? At Supriim Vegan, you&#x2019;ll be able to do just that without having to feel guilty five minutes later.&#x201D; She said she wanted to start with an outlet in the city centre with the aim of delighting customers with &#x201C;junk food&#x201D; that have a clean and healthy twist.She will source all her organic ingredients locally and providing a 100&#x2005;percent vegan alternative where very few options currently exist.Business Partners executive director Christo Botes said the competition was opened to aspiring entrepreneurs between the ages of 18 and 35. &quot;It aims to have a positive impact on promising South African entrepreneurs by bridging the gap between simply having an idea and actually launching a start-up business.&#x201D;Botes said Ndabandaba&#x2019;s business plan was selected based on her innovation in capitalising on the fast-growing healthy eating trend by providing wholesome vegan and gluten-free snacks to those seeking tasty, environmentally-friendly food.&#x201C;Nosisa impressed us with not only the presentation of her business plan, but the substance therein as well. Her dedication, drive and passion came through clearly.&quot;Nosisa identified an opportunity to gain access into a rather trendy market. The business idea is a viable one &#x2013; there is a global movement to living a healthy lifestyle and Nosisa is capitalising on it with a vegan store.&#x201D;He said young entrepreneurs took part in one of 12 regional business workshops across the country on the intricacies of compiling a business plan and managing the many functions of running a &#x2028;business.
