THE City has launched a Shark Spotters mobile application aimed at enhancing beach safety as summer fast approaches, with beach-goers expected to flood Cape Town&apos;s shores.The Shark Spotters mobile application conveniently provides water users with current and accurate shark safety information on their smartphones so they can make informed decisions about shark risks, even before arriving at the beach.Unique and innovative, the app will assist swimmers and surfers to be more shark-smart at beaches, said Mayco member for energy, environmental and spatial planning Johan van der Merwe.In giving users access to real-time information, the app allowed shark spotters to render a more efficient and effective service to the community, he said.&#x201C;We believe the Shark Spotters app will be an essential beach safety and information tool for all water users in Cape Town during the upcoming beach season.&#x201C;This app will provide keen surfers and swimmers with specific information about their favourite beach spots even before they travel to them,&#x201D; he added.It will provide water users with all the latest shark safety information at City beaches, including which flag was currently flying and why, said Van der Merwe.The flags, he said, are flown for various reasons, including poor spotting conditions due to cloud cover, shark sightings, indication of water temperature, the lunar phase and indication of whether the shark exclusion barrier in Fish Hoek is being deployed or not.The app is updated by on-duty shark spotters in real time so that users are assured of the most current information to help them make a personal assessment about shark risks when entering the water, he added.Beach-goers will appreciate the app for all the information of interest it offers, including weather conditions and marine animal activity in the area (such as whales, seals, dolphins and sunfish), details of beach amenities and short surf videos of isolated surf spots covered by the programme that do not have live webcams in operation, he added.The app includes safety tips to reduce the risk of encountering a shark and information about shark activity in Cape Town.&#x201C;We&apos;re very grateful to all individuals and organisations who contributed to making the app a reality and are very excited to be able to be a key partner in this initiative.&#x201C;Shark Spotters is an invaluable partner doing some great work,&#x201D; he said.The app is available on iOS and Android platforms and is free to download.
