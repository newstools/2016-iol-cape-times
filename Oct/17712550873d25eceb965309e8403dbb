JOHANNESBURG: The SA Police Service (SAPS) has paid its officers over R3 million for overtime work at universities in Gauteng since the start of the #FeesMustFall campaign, Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said on Tuesday.Nkosi-Malobane responded to a question by EFF MPL Patrick Sindane on the deployment of police officers at &#x2028;universities.At least 1 368 officers were deployed at the Witwatersrand University&#x2019;s campuses alone, with R67 855 spent so far on meals for the officers, said Nkosi-Malobane.When asked about reports that Wits student leader Mcebo Dlamini was on a hunger strike at Johannesburg Prison, Nkosi-Malobane said &#x201C;there is no such a thing&#x201D;.&#x201C;Mcebo Dlamini is not on hunger strike, I can confirm that. Furthermore, he is not in solitary confinement. He is in high care at the prison &#x2013; that is an isolated area because we do not want him to be the target of common law prisoners,&#x201D; she told the MPLs.Dlamini is one of the &#x2028;leaders of the #FeesMustfall campaign that has swept through the country&#x2019;s campuses in the past six weeks.He was denied bail by the Johannesburg Magistrate&#x2019;s Court last week and is facing charges relating to public violence, theft and malicious damage to property. Dlamini was expected back in court on November 15.Students at public universities have abandoned classes and have been protesting for weeks demanding free higher education.The protests have been marred by injuries and destruction of university property as running battles between students and police continue.
