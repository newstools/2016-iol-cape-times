A FISH Hoek resident says his local councillor broke his arm when an argument over a parking space escalated into a tussle.Michael Kerr claims DA Ward 61 councillor Simon Liell-Cock had refused to move his car, which he had parked in Kerr&apos;s driveway last Wednesday before the two were involved in a fight.&#x201C;I asked around but couldn&apos;t find the owner of the vehicle. I waited for the driver to come, then I saw he had a councillor&apos;s disc in his windshield and went inside a nearby council building, where security notified him,&#x201D; said Kerr.Liell-Cock was conducting interviews and Kerr was told he could not be disturbed, but the Fish Hoek resident was persistent, demanding the vehicle be removed from his driveway so he could leave his home.Liell-Cock eventually came out of the interview and apologised to Kerr, who remained adamant he wanted the car moved.He said what angered him was that there were clearly visible yellow lines indicating no parking was permitted, but the councillor still &#x201C;blocked&#x201D; him into his driveway.&#x201C;He tried to delay moving his vehicle but I said &#x2018;no&#x2019;. &#x2028;I told him I&#x2019;d let down the air in his tyres if he did not move his vehicle. He then barged into me.&#x201C;We went outside and he again pointed in my face,&#x201D; said Kerr.The two men allegedly got into a tussle and Kerr ended up on the ground. He alleged the councillor kicked his arm, followed by another kick towards the groin.&#x201C;Afterwards he got into his car,&#x201D; said Kerr.He said when he finally got into his car, he noticed that his arm was swollen and went to a local hospital, where staff confirmed that it was broken.Liell-Cock refused to comment on the incident, only saying he had been charged with common assault.DA chief whip in the City of Cape Town Shaun August said yesterday he had not been informed about the incident.Council Speaker Dirk Smit said he had no information on the incident but would make enquiries.The ANC&#x2019;s leader in council, Xolani Sotashe, weighed in on the incident, saying this was the third incident in which one of the DA councillors was found to have acted violently.He said DA councillors were &#x201C;power drunk&#x201D; following their two-thirds majority, which was exemplified by their recent behaviour.&#x201C;But we are going to make sure that Liell-Cock is held accountable,&#x201D; said Sotashe.
