IT MAY have been business as usual during the day at Wits University yesterday, but as dusk began to set in, #FeesMustFall protesters shut down Braamfontein by burning a bus with passengers inside it.A police van and a fire engine were also set alight as the fiery protests resumed.Rubber bullet casings, rocks and shattered concrete bins littered the ground as a police car burnt and its windows shattered in the flames.But as soon as that fire was put out, a bigger blaze lit up the night skies as a Rea Vaya bus was torched at the intersection of Rissik and De Korte streets.A homeless man said he saw protesters run up to the bus, containing three passengers and the driver.&#x201C;Three protesters had beer bottles that were on fire and they threw them on the bus, which was turning. The driver and passengers had to break the windows to get out,&#x201D; the man said, adding that the driver ran off after escaping the flames.Students sang protest songs such as Senzeni na (What have we done?) into the darkness as a heavily armed police presence grew and civilians looked on from surrounding buildings.A fire engine was also burnt, according to Joburg Emergency Management Services (JEMS). &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t take a chance, our fire engine was stoned earlier on and it&#x2019;s out of commission already, we need to be protected,&#x201D; JEMS said in a tweet.Joburg metro police department spokesperson Superintendent Edna Mamonyane said: &#x201C;Protesters, allegedly students, are out in the streets of Braamfontein. It is reported that they had a meeting at the Holy Trinity Church in Braamfontein and after the meeting they went onto the streets.&#x201C;They have blockaded Jan Smuts Avenue and Jorissen Street with rocks and concrete rubbish bins.&#x201D;A witness to the police car burning, who didn&#x2019;t want to be named, said she saw about seven men who seemed to be students throw rocks at the police. After the police fired two rubber bullets, one of the men threw something at the police car, which then blew up.Traffic was affected as Jan Smuts Avenue was closed off by police. Mamonyane said there were reports from motorists who said students threw stones at them.During the day, there were few disruptions at Wits, according to spokesperson Shirona Patel, who said two incidents were reported.&#x201D; A firecracker was thrown into an open window in a classroom at the FNB building on the Braamfontein West Campus.The class was affected, but after a few minutes, students settled down and the lecture resumed.&#x201C;There are reports that firecrackers were also set off on the Wits Education Campus, but no classes were disrupted,&#x201D; Patel said.
