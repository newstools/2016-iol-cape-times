It was reported yesterday that the NPA was considering dropping charges against Gordhan, former Sars boss Oupa Magashula and ex-deputy commissioner Ivan Pillay.Malatji denied reports of discussions between them and the NPA.He said the issue of discussions could be based on the fact that they did not make representations to NPA head Shaun Abrahams.He said when Gordhan appears in court on Wednesday it will be the usual postponement and the setting up of the trial date.&#x201C;There are no discussions whatsoever, the NDPP (National Director of Public Prosecutions) exercises his discretion independently. The NDPP is still considering the matter, no decision has been taken in respect of the representations made by Mr Pillay and Mr Magashula.&#x201D;City Press reported Abrahams was meeting with his close colleagues in the NPA to drop charges against Gordhan, Magashula and Pillay.
