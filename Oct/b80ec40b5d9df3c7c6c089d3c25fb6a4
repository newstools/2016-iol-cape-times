THE Health Professions Council of South Africa&apos;s (HPCSA) professional conduct committee chair, Joan Adams, says pages of her case documents were ripped out at the inquiry into Professor Tim Noakes&#x2019;s professional conduct.After returning from a lunch break, an agitated Adams said her documents had been tampered with.She asked the first group of legal representatives entering the room from that point on to be &#x201C;vigilant&#x201D;.&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t want documents disappearing or being ripped out of bundles. My documents were tampered with during the lunch hour and there may have been one or two other documents tampered with,&#x201D; she said.Members of the media and public were not to look at or tamper with any documentation, Adams said.Noakes, who has 77&#x202F;000 Twitter followers, is defending himself at the HPCSA inquiry into his professional conduct.He has been accused of &#x2028;acting unprofessionally by advising Pippa Leenstra to wean her baby onto a low-carb, high-fat diet (LCHF). Leenstra tweeted him and nutritional therapist Sally-Ann Creed, The Real Meal Revolution co-author, to ask if the LCHF Banting diet was safe for babies of breast-&#x2028;feeding mothers.Noakes replied on Twitter: &#x201C;Baby doesn&#x2019;t eat the dairy and cauliflower. Just very healthy high-fat breast milk. Key is to wean baby on to LCHF.&#x201D;The tweet spurred over 500 responses, but under cross-examination yesterday, Noakes said Twitter is a self-correcting forum and a space for other experts to challenge him, enabling his followers to decide to follow his advice or not.Noakes also said he was not conducting a medical consultation, but responded as a scientist to the tweet and that social media complements medicine and doctor-patient relations, and does not replace it. &#x2028;&#x201C;Social media is not replacing doctor-patient relations.&#x201D;He added that Leenstra had full access to medical services and abundant advice from other health practitioners.&#x201C;We have to educate people today not to be led by the &#x2028;opinion of one or two. It is up to each of us to make decisions on the basis of the best possible evidence.&#x201D;HPCSA advocate Ajay Bhoopchand said Twitter posed limitations when it came to the exchange of medical advice a health practitioner can communicate with users and, in this case, Noakes&#x2019; advice created confusion.Bhoopchand questioned Noakes&apos;s expertise on giving advice about infant and neonatal care.&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see myself as a doctor, I see myself as a scientist, giving scientific information. There is no one better able in SA to talk about the LCHF diet,&quot; Noakes replied.
