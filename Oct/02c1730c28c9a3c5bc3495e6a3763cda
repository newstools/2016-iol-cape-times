FORMER Western Province captain Divan Serfontein and SA Rugby Union legend Cassiem Jabaar have reacted with shock to reports that the Western Province Rugby Football Union could be facing a crippling R72&#xA0;million lawsuit.It was reported yesterday that Aerios (Pty) Limited &#x2028;will be claiming R72 million &#x2028;from the WP Rugby over a sponsorship dispute.The dispute is believed to revolve around a sponsorship contract between WP Rugby and DHL (main sponsors of Newlands, Stormers and WP) without the consent of Aerios &#x2013; holders of the union&apos;s commercial rights.WP Rugby president Thelo Wakefield refused to be drawn into the matter yesterday.&#x201C;No comment. I will not comment until we meet with the board.&#x201D;Jabaar, a legendary Saru scrumhalf in the 1970s, said: &#x201C;This was an issue that was raised before in general council meetings, and it&#x2019;s only surfacing now.&quot;This is a huge administrative problem because they should know what contracts they go into. If they go into any contract, they cannot just do things the way they want to do things.&#x201C;This issue was raised three years ago and I was a part of that. If Wakefield is now back here with us, he has to answer to what &#x2028;went wrong.&#x201D;&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going to happen if we lose this case. Western Province are &#x2028;overextending themselves.&#x201D;Serfontein, who led WP to three successive Currie Cup titles in the 1980s, said: &#x201C;There needs to be a big shake-up&#x2028;(at WP).&quot;They need to do a forensic audit to find where the problem lies with their finances. The people who aren&#x2019;t competent need to &#x2028;be fired. Our rugby is really not managed properly.&#x201D;
