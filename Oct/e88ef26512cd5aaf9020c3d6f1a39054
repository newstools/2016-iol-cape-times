The South African Policing Union yesterday called on Police Minister Nathi Nhleko to &#x201C;show maturity and leadership by swallowing his pride&#x201D; and reversing the appointment of Lieutenant-General Berning Ntlemeza as head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks).Sapu general secretary Oscar Skommere said the minister failed to follow procedure in appointing the Hawks boss in that he didn&#x2019;t notify the National Assembly within the prescribed time.&#x201C;The minister is called upon to just reverse this controversial appointment. We are on record as voicing our opposition to Ntlemeza&#x2019;s initial appointment from the day the minister appointed him in an acting capacity. He was never the best candidate to lead an elite unit like the Hawks.&#x201D;Skommere said Ntlemeza&#x2019;s poor record was well documented.&#x201C;Our opposition to his appointment is not a personal vendetta. We are concerned about service delivery, as mediocrity will cost the police the respect they deserve. Already the Hawks&#x2019; record is a far cry from what is expected of them.&#x201C;A mature leader is the one who acknowledges his mistakes and owns them. This is an opportune time for the minister to rectify his initial shortcoming by appointing such a poor commander to lead a vital security organ like the Hawks.&#x201C;General Ntlemeza has been a laughing stock of our time. He doesn&#x2019;t command any respect, even among the Hawks ranks, let alone the criminals.&#x201D;Skommere said the fact that Ntlemeza&#x2019;s appointment was irregular meant it could be legally challenged and that the Hawks couldn&#x2019;t afford to have a poor commander.Nhleko and Ntlemeza could not immediately be reached for comment. &#x2013; ANA
