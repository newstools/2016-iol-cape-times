THE World Medical Association (WMA) has thrown its weight behind the proposed tax on sugary drinks, calling for the regulation of food and beverages sold and served &#x2028;at educational and health-care facilities.Delegates at the WMA&apos;s annual assembly in Taiwan have appealed for a comprehensive programme to prevent childhood obesity, including consideration of a tax on non-nutritious foods and sugary drinks.WMA president Dr Ketan Desai said: &#x201C;We are urging &#x2028;governments to consider imposing a tax on non-nutritious foods and sugary drinks, and to use the additional revenue to fund research into preventing childhood obesity &#x2028;and reducing the resulting disease risk.&#x201D;While the government proposes to introduce the tax on sugar-sweetened beverages by April 1, the Beverages Association of South Africa has come out strongly against the tax, saying the non-alcoholic beverage industry contributes R60&#xA0;billion to South Africa&#x2019;s GDP and supports about 294&#xA0;000 jobsThe WMA also wants to see initiatives taken on advertising and marketing, and &#x2028;labelling.Delegates at the assembly said the link between living &#x2028;in poverty and early childhood obesity continued to negatively affect health in &#x2028;adult life.Recent studies showed that marketing targeted at children had a wide influence on the shopping trends and food preferences of households all over the world.Special offers, short-term price reductions and other price promotions and advertising on social as well as traditional media all play a role in increasing product demand.&#x201C;We know there is a link between the extent of advertising and childhood obesity, so we are recommending that the advertising of non-nutritious products on television be restricted during programmes that appeal to children.&#x201C;Children frequently watch programmes designed for adults, so regulators must ensure that legislation and regulation also limits marketing associated with such programmes,&#x201D; Desai said.The WMA assembly has also called for schools to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines, and governments to work with independent health experts &#x2028;on sound guidance in food &#x2028;and nutrition, with no involvement of the food and drink industry.Combating childhood obesity should include initiatives on price and availability of nutritious foods, access to education, advertising and marketing, information, labelling and other areas specific to regions and countries.The WMA has recommended that the ministries of Health and Education regulate food and beverages sold and served at educational and health-care facilities, and that quality education be offered in formal settings to children aged from two to three years, combined with enrichment activities for parents.The WMA also called for sufficient supply of nutritious food and beverages, which may help to decrease the rate of adolescent obesity and reduce its health implications throughout the life course.
