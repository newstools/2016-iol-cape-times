TWENTY-FIVE students who were remanded in custody for a week following violent unrest at CPUT&#x2019;s Bellville campus have been released on bail of R3&#x2005;000 each after appearing in court.The matter was heard on Wednesday after the State obtained all the background information it required to decide whether to oppose their release on bail.None of the students had any previous convictions, pending criminal cases or outstanding arrest warrants.They appeared before magistrate Ronald Rickerts, who warned them not to set foot on the campus again until the finalisation of the case, except for exams.They were also warned not to participate in any further student protests and if they did, they would be rearrested and remain in custody until the case had been finalised.If rearrested, no other court in the country would allow them bail again, the magistrate warned.Of the group, 24 face charges of public violence while the last one, who was caught in possession of a petrol bomb, is charged with possession of an explosive device.They are expected back in court on November 28.Meanwhile, the City called on businesses and affected residents to open criminal cases against student protesters who damaged cars and looted several shops in the CBD on Wednesday.Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said six people were arrested when chaos broke out during a march to Parliament.He said four of the protesters will be charged with public violence and two for assaulting a police officer.&#x201C;The City of Cape Town&#x2019;s security directorate is aware of one law enforcement vehicle, four Metro police &#x2028;vehicles, two SAPS vehicles, one MyCiTi bus, a private vehicle, an unconfirmed number of Golden Arrow buses and a number of buildings &#x2028;in the Parliament precinct having been damaged by &#x2028;protesters.&#x201D;Thousands of students marched through the CBD as Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan delivered his Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement and announced that an additional R17.6 billion will be made available to tertiary institutions over the next three years.Smith said video footage of the protest will be used to identify and prosecute offenders.He said clean-up operations will start &#x201C;as soon as resources allow&#x201D;.
