PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has given notice of his intention to suspend two deputy national directors of public prosecutions, advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi, from office pending an inquiry into their fitness to hold office.&#x201C;The president&#x2019;s decision follows the recent judgment of the North Gauteng High Court in the &#x2028;matter of the General Council of Bar of South Africa vs Nomgcobo Jiba, Lawrence Sithembiso Mrwebi and Sibongile Mzinyathi in which the court ordered that the names of the two advocates be removed from the roll of advocates,&#x201D; the Presidency said yesterday.&#x201C;The president has requested the two advocates provide him with reasons why they cannot be suspended pending the outcome of the enquiry into their fitness to hold office.&#x201D;After hearing from the two advocates, the Presidency said, Zuma will take a decision whether or not to suspend them.The DA welcomed the move, calling it long overdue.DA justice spokesperson Glynnis Breytenbach said this intention bodes well for ridding the National Prosecuting Authority of those who wish to compromise our nation&#x2019;s prosecutorial integrity.Last month, the North Gauteng High Court granted an application by the General Bar Council to have Jiba and Mrwebi removed from the roll of advocates.&#x201C;This judgment was not handed down lightly. She has also been accused of lying to the court, failing to comply with court orders, ignoring deadlines, failing to exercise an independent mind, and shielding irrational and illegal actions from judicial scrutiny. Clearly she is not fit for office.&#x201C;Both Jiba and Mrwebi will have an opportunity to present their arguments as to why they should not be suspended, but will be hard-pressed to convince any sound-minded person that they should not be &#x2028;suspended.&#x201D;
