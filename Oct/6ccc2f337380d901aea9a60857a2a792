INDEPENDENT MEDIA has announced the appointment of three regional executive editors: Gasant Abarder (Western Cape), Kevin Ritchie (Gauteng) and Alan Dunn (KwaZulu-Natal).These appointments have been made in the regions in which Independent&#x2019;s print titles have significant readership and operations. The appointments have been made in the wake of the resignation of former group chief content officer Karima Brown, who played a national role.In terms of its strategic repositioning, Independent took the decision, after consideration, to appoint regional executive editors rather than replacing the position vacated at national level.All three candidates appointed to these positions have extensive journalistic experience, and have all recently been editors at major daily titles in the regions &#x2028;mentioned.Abarder, appointed regional executive editor in the Western Cape, has worked in TV and radio, but has spent most of his career in print media. He was part of the founding team of the Daily Voice and was deputy editor there, then became Cape Argus editor in 2009.He left Independent for a brief spell and returned in 2013 as editor of the Cape Times. In 2015, he returned to the Cape Argus as editor.In 2015, Abarder oversaw the acclaimed student #FeesMustfall co-edited edition in &#x2028;October, the #DignityProject (a three-week series about homeless people in Cape Town) in 2016 and also started a weekly column, &#x201C;Friday Files&#x201D;, profiling movers and shakers in the Western Cape who make an impact in and beyond the boundaries of the region.&#x201C;This exciting new opportunity allows me to step back from being involved in newsrooms for almost two decades, and to plough my experience and knowledge into the strategic management of Independent Media&#x2019;s titles in the Western Cape.&#x201C;It is an opportune moment as Indy is on the brink of a revolutionary transformation of all of its platforms &#x2013; in both print and digital.&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be working closely with the teams in editorial, marketing, advertising and our newly formed specialised content business units to further enhance the already incredible and well-established brands in the Independent Media stable.&#x201D;Ritchie, who has been appointed executive regional editor in Gauteng, is a 25-year veteran of Independent, having edited the group&#x2019;s smallest and biggest daily newspapers, the Diamond Fields Advertiser (DFA) in Kimberley and most recently The Star in Johannesburg, a flagship publication in the group.This is among a host of other senior editorial,&#x2028;commercial and managerial appointments, making him eminently suitable for this appointment.&#x201C;I never thought anything could be better than editing The Star for the last two-and-a-half years, but this job has the potential to do just that. I&#x2019;m looking forward to serving the editors in the region and their staff,&#x201D; said Ritchie.Dunn, appointed KwaZulu-Natal regional executive editor, is a 43-year veteran with the group.During his illustrious career, he has served Independent in various capacities and worked in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban. Dunn has also worked in Washington DC, Windhoek and has served as parliamentary editor for Independent.&#x201C;I appreciate the honour of this post, and accept the challenge. I&#x2019;ve had many assignments in a rich career, and this one excites me no less than the others,&#x201D; said Dunn.In welcoming the three editors into these positions, executive chairman Dr Iqbal Surv&#xE9; said the digital first, print best strategy required the repositioning of the regional titles of the group and leadership at a regional level would be an important driver in the continued quest for excellence in a rapidly changing media environment.&#x201C;The extensive experience of the regional executive editors enables them to contribute to this exercise, as &#x2028;they can focus on the regional titles, spot replication, contribute to quality control of &#x2028;the brands, amongst other &#x2028;contributions.&#x201C;All three of them have impressed me with their commitment to excellent journalism and I am so pleased that they have accepted these strategic editorial positions.&#x201C;I have every confidence in them as they take up their new roles in Independent Media,&#x201D; said Surv&#xE9;.New editor for The Young Independents Independent Media has also announced the appointment of the first editor of its online platform for millennials, The Young Independents.Saajida Francis, an Honours journalism graduate from Rhodes University, with a solid digital background, will spearhead the company&#x2019;s youth&#x2028;platform.&#x201C;This is an extremely exciting time for Independent Media as we roll out our various offerings for the youth market. Saajida is a highly talented young woman with immense skill. Her appointment is in line with our objective to nurture and develop young talent,&#x201D; said Surv&#xE9;.Francis expressed her excitement at having been appointed the first editor of The Young Independents.&#x201C;I am incredibly overwhelmed by this opportunity. As a black female millennial who has always been intrigued by the evolution of the digital sphere, I see this as an opportunity to enhance the youth experience through The Young Independents.&#x201C;The Young Independents will proudly provide an authentic, unapologetic and real narrative to young&#x2028;South Africans who seek an honest and accurate media &#x2028;perspective.&#x201C;What is truly exciting about this opportunity is realising that South Africa&#x2019;s population is largely made up of young people: those who are below the age of 35&#xA0;years constitute about 66 percent of the total population. The Young Independents will be an active agent in guiding their digital experience through solutions- based journalism.&#x201C;With a talented team of phenomenal individuals, The Young Independents is truly destined for great success, and I am humbled and sincerely grateful to be a part of this journey&#x201D;, said Francis.Aziz Hartley takes over the reins at Cape ArgusNewspaper stalwart Hartley has been appointed editor of the Cape Argus.
