Cape Town - People should start eating they way they did before dietary guidelines were developed, investigative journalist and author of the Big Fat Surprise, Nina Teicholz said on Tuesday.Teicholz was on the stand at a hearing into Banting advocate Professor Tim Noakes s professional conduct before the Health Professionals Council of SA.Teicholz said the only way she could see the world overcoming the obesity and diabetes epidemic it faced was if people went back to eating like they did in 1965, before carbohydrate-based dietary guidelines came into play.Even though people are sticking to the dietary food guidelines they are not losing weight, Teicholz said.Noakes is facing a charge of unprofessional conduct after he responded to Pippa Leenstra s tweet that babies should be weaned onto a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet.Leenstra had tweeted him and nutritional therapist Sally-Ann Creed asking if it was safe for breast-feeding mothers to be on the Banting diet.Noakes tweeted back: Baby doesn t eat the dairy and cauliflower. Just very healthy high fat breast milk. Key is to wean baby on to LCHF. lynette.johns@inl.co.za* For the full story read the Cape Times tomorrowCape Times
