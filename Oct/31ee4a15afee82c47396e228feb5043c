Hlaudi Motsoeneng has once again raised the ire of the South African Indian community, this time over comments he made about changing the name of Lotus FM.The SABC head of corporate services told the Tsonga traditional leadership on Wednesday that he was tired of names like Lotus FM, which didn&#x2019;t represent &#x201C;our culture&#x201D;.Motsoeneng angered Indians earlier this year when the 90&#x2005;percent music quota he introduced on SABC radio stations caused Lotus FM to lose listeners.The Star&#x2019;s sister newspaper, The Mercury, attempted to reach SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago for comment yesterday but he hadn&#x2019;t responded by the time of publication.Prominent members of the Indian community said Motsoeneng&#x2019;s proposal was undemocratic.&#x201C;There is no way we will accept the SABC changing the name of Lotus, which has cultural significance,&#x201D; said Pietermaritzburg businessman Sunny Gayadin.The lotus flower was a symbol of Hinduism, and many of the religion&#x2019;s gods were linked to it. It was associated with spirituality and prosperity, he said.&#x201C;The constitution is clear, &#x2028;in its entirety, that cultural and religious tolerance must be accommodated by all race groups and religions,&#x201D; Gayadin added.Former eThekwini Speaker Logie Naidoo said: &#x201C;Hlaudi must come to realise the mandate of Lotus is to play Indian music and to air vernacular music, just like Zulu and Venda (stations).&#x201C;There must be a strong argument (made) to change the name.&#x201D;He said Indians were upset about the negative effect the imposed music had on Lotus FM.&#x201C;The policy flopped and listenership dropped. They tried the same thing with (lifestyle TV show) Mela (formerly Eastern Mosaic) by trying to make it into a Top Billing-like show and I don&#x2019;t think that went well.&#x201D;University of Johannesburg sociology department&#x2019;s Ashwin Desai said: &#x201C;He obviously feasted on a lotus plant, because he&#x2019;s (deluded) because he&#x2019;s not going to be able to change that name.&#x201D;Desai added the lotus flower was originally from Egypt and, therefore, a part of African soil.South African Hindu Maha Sabha president Ashwin Trikamjee said the issue would require a debate and consultation with the community.&#x201C;This is not a matter for traditional leaders to decide. We will ensure that this (the thorough debate) happens, as the SABC is the national broadcaster, serving the needs of all sections of the South African society.&#x201D;
