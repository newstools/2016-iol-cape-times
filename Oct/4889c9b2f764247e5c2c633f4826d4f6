THE point of no return to salvage the 2016 academic year has been reached, CPUT acting vice-chancellor Louis Fourie said yesterday as the institution decided to cancel face-to-face classes in light of continued student protests at its campuses.An urgent senate executive committee meeting was convened on Tuesday, where the decision was made.&#x201C;We had several fruitful engagements with leaders from the student community, and decided more than once on a date to resume classes. Unfortunately, this has not been realised until now, quite often due to circumstances beyond our control.&quot;We have now reached the point of no return to save the 2016 academic year.&#x201D;Assessment processes will take place in January.CPUT says all departments and modules that are ready will continue with final integrated summative assessments next month and in December. Students will be advised of the new assessment timetable and venues.Priority will be given to exit-level modules.Students who do not write their final assessments next month or in December are urged to go home for their own safety, Fourie said.Yesterday, chaos erupted at CPUT&#x2019;s Cape Town campus as a group of about 1&#xA0;000 students and workers mobilised for a march to Parliament, where Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan delivered his mini-budget.A memorandum on free, decolonised education was accepted by Gordhan.Earlier this week, several vehicles were set a light at the Bellville campus. Students, however, distanced themselves from the acts.Students have also slated the decision to put vice-chancellor Prins Nevhutalu on special leave.
