ARTS and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa has warned against the SACP breaking away from the ruling alliance movement, saying it would be the death knell of the ANC, which had come out of the Cope and EFF splits bruised. If this alliance is divided, it would be over for this movement. We survived the PAC, the UDM and Cope. We also survived the EFF. We will not survive this time around, Mthethwa warned.He made the remarks against the backdrop of sustained calls by the Young Communist League of SA (YCLSA) for the SACP to contest the 2019 national elections on its own.Delivering a political education lecture to thousands of KwaZulu-Natal ANC Youth League members in the Durban City Hall on Sunday, Mthethwa said history would judge the alliance leaders harshly if they allowed another split. Our children and our grandchildren will have all the right to come and spit on our graves, because we would have sold out the blood, sweat and tears of our forebears, he said.The minister was responding to input by the eThekwini ANCYL regional secretary, Thinta Cibane, who called for the ANC to be proactive and address the YCLSA s calls for its mother body to go it alone in the elections.However, Mthethwa said a split should be avoided at all costs because if the SACP were to contest the elections on its own, it would leave with ANC members . He appealed to the ANC Youth League to engage its YCLSA counterparts and teach them the importance of the alliance. So, comrades, let us challenge these comrades The ANCYL has a duty to challenge the YCLSA politically. It has a duty to engage them, to correct them and to make them see the bigger picture, said Mthethwa.YCLSA provincial secretary Mlungisi Manana said if the SACP were to contest the 2019 elections, it would amass enough votes to go it alone.
