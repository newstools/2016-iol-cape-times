PETROSA workers have taken to protest after reports emerged at the weekend that the state oil company paid 11 senior executives millions of rands in bonuses despite a loss of more than R14 billion in the past financial year. More than 100 workers protested outside PetroSA s offices in Parow yesterday. It has been reported that money was paid to the executives even though staff members were told that there were no funds for performance bonuses. The 11 executives apparently received payouts totalling R17.3 million even after the board said they did not deserve them. This was despite staff members reportedly being told that they would not be receiving bonuses for a second year in a row. Representing the workers, Mncedisi Siza said they were told they would not be receiving bonuses because of the dire situation PetroSA is in. Among those alleged to have benefited from the payouts are geosciences and data manager Andrew Dippenaar. He was responsible for the unsuccessful Project Ikhwezi, which explored for gas off Mossel Bay. PetroSA legal services head Mokgaetsi Sebothoma, who led the failed Project Irene, and acting vice-president of new ventures, Thabiso Manne, were also reported to have received bonuses. These people presided over failed programmes. We want to voice our anger and frustration at what is happening, Siza said. The matter had been referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, Siza said, and workers were drawing up a memo of demands. There are also issues around management of PetroSA which we want addressed. The policies of the company has been violated. We will keep on doing this until our demands are met, he said. PetroSA spokesman Thabo Mabaso declined to comment yesterday. However, he confirmed that employees were protesting in Cape Town and Mossel Bay.[email&#160;protected]
