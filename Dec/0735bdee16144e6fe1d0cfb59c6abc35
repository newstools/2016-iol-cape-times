SKATEBOARDERS from around Cape Town showed off their skill and flair at the Shred Christmas Party and Skate contest last week. Held at the The Shred indoor skatepark in Paarden Eiland, talented skaters competed for a R10&nbsp;000 cash prize and R15&nbsp;000 worth of products. Jamie O Brien, of The Shred, said the festive-season competition challenged those involved by throwing obstacles into the mix. This is not your normal contest as it is more challenge and best-trick-driven. This year, we added street obstacles like a fire hydrant, picnic bench, speed bump and China bank, he said. Some of the other challenges we had were 'highest air', 'longest grind', and 'grab the cash on the vert wall'. Winners included Milnerton local Allan Adams. Earlier this year, Adams also won the Element Make It Count competition, which saw him compete in Barcelona, Spain. His elder brother Gavin &quot;Moses&quot; Adams was also a winner. Ryan Naidoo aka Santa, Karl Van Antwerp, and Yann-Xavier Horowitz also claimed top spots.
