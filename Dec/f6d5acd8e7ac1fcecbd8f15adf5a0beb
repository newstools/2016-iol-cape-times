WITH summer holidays looming notoriously as the period when children are most prone to go missing, the City has come up with a plan to weave a safety net for Hanover Park children.The child safety pilot project, launched on Friday, aims to fast-track the authorities response times in the crucial first few hours of a child s disappearance, and to raise awareness of the steps involved in fast-tracking the community s response times. The project had its roots in a local ward councillor s request after 3-year-old Sasha-Lee November s disappearance in Hanover Park in May last year, said Mayco member for Social Development and Early Childhood Development, Councillor Suzette Little. The idea is quite simple. We want to ensure that the community knows what to do as soon as it becomes apparent that a child has disappeared, she said. Those first two hours after a person goes missing are crucial, and the more resources we can co-ordinate and mobilise in that time, the better the chances of finding them. Recognising the police as being primarily responsible for tracing missing persons, she said the pilot project supported existing measures by pooling the city s resources, including Women in Rental Stock initiative members, the Metro Police, neighbourhood safety officer and City enforcement agencies, to solidify the response if a child disappeared. The project s support for the police is through a city-appointed suburb co-ordinator, who is trained in this regard and would have specific responsibilities after having been informed about the incident.These include getting relevant information from the affected family, including recent photographs and informing the Public Emergency Communication Centre and relevant missing persons organisations.They also include getting the city s Metro Police and traffic services to set up vehicle checkpoints, or to use the city s CCTV technology to assist in the search, and liaising with the police.The suburb co-ordinator would also be expected to mobilise the community to set up search parties and distribute information, photographs and flyers, and publish details of the missing child via social media and other information-sharing platforms. I m happy that we have developed this protocol as it gives everyone a clear idea of what to do in the event that a child disappears, but of course the first prize is to prevent child abduction, said Little.
