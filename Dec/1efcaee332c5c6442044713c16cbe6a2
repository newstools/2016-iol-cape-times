SAVOURING a warm, nutritious meal happens only a few times a year for Anetta Snyders, who has been homeless for 10 years.She was promised work in Cape Town when she was 36, but was disappointed when she arrived.Originally from Ceres, Snyders sleeps on an open field in District Six with several others.She was among about 600 homeless people who were treated to a Christmas lunch in the City yesterday organised by congregants of the Central Methodist Mission on Greenmarket Square, and Ladles of Love a volunteer-run organisation that runs feeding programmes for the homeless. I really like cooking, but I never get to make anything besides rice and some vegetables. I also often wonder where my next meal will come from because I have to skarrel, and sometimes people don't give you anything, she said.Snyders has three children two of which are in foster care.Her 23-year-old daughter works in Wellington. This is a lekker present from the church. Thank you to the organisers for arranging this, Snyders said.Ladles of Love founder Danny Diliberto said the organisation had worked hard to restore the dignity of homeless people throughout the year. We have been in partnership with the church for the last two years, and we supplied the food for this lunch, and the church supplied the chairs and tables.&quot;Everything today was possible because of donations, Diliberto said.To donate, visit www.ladlesoflove.co.za [email&#160;protected]
