WASHINGTON: Time magazine yesterday named US President-elect Donald Trump as its Person of the Year. It s a great honour. It means a lot, Trump said in a telephone interview on NBC s Today show.Time editor Nancy Gibbs said on the programme that Democrat Hillary Clinton was the No 2 finalist. Gibbs said the choice of Trump this year was straightforward . When have we ever seen a single individual who has so defied expectations, broken the rules, violated norms, beaten not one but two political parties on the way to winning an election that he entered with 100-to-1 odds against him? Gibbs asked.The Time cover reads, Donald Trump: President of the Divided States of America , and the cover image features a photograph of the president-elect sitting in his private residence at Trump Tower.In the NBC interview, Trump took issue with the Divided States of America description: I didn t divide them, he said. We re going to put it back together and we re going to have a country that s very well heeled. Gibbs said Time gives the title to the person who has had the greatest influence on events for better or worse .Trump went from fiery underdog in the race for the Republican presidential nomination to defeating Clinton in the November 8 election. Trump won 306 electoral votes, easily enough to make him president when the electors meet on December 19. Clinton won the popular vote.Gibbs said Clinton came closer than any woman ever has to winning the White House, and in the process revealed, I think, both the opportunities and the obstacles that women face in the public square. No 3 went to The Hackers , a new cyber security threat and something very disturbing , Gibbs said. AP
