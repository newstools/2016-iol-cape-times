The EFF s labelling of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as a murderer was unparliamentary, the Western Cape High Court has ruled, after party leader Julius Malema s bid to overturn his removal from the House last September. Malema was removed during a question and answer session for making spurious and unsubstantiated allegations against Ramaphosa. He was ejected from the House after refusing to withdraw the remark. Malema wanted the decision by Parliament to remove him for his conduct, which defied the authority of the presiding officer and caused disruption to the session of the House, to be overturned by the court. In a statement last night, ANC caucus spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said the judgment affirmed the National Assembly rules and the authority they grant the presiding officers to swiftly remove MPs whose conduct is disruptive or threatens to collapse the proceedings of the House . The judgment further affirms the constitutional prerogative of Parliament to determine its own internal arrangements, proceedings and procedures to govern its business, he said.The court found the presiding officer acted reasonably and concurred with Parliament that Malema s behaviour was disruptive and warranted his removal. The court said allegations of improper conduct against other parliamentary members could not be made without a substantive motion supported by concrete evidence. It is common knowledge Malema would not have any evidence to support his malicious political posturing, which makes his utterances abusive of the freedom of speech, Mothapo said. He added the judgment would go a long way in protecting Parliament from unwarranted disruptions while guarding against abuse of MPs freedom of speech .
