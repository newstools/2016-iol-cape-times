THE family of a 28-year-old inmate who died in Pollsmoor Prison s remand section are demanding answers after finding his body in a morgue last week.Isroedien Stemmet's family members identified his body on Friday after they were told of his death by prisoners.His aunt, Levona Carstens, said she raised Stemmet, a Tafelsig resident, as her own after his mother died.Carstens vowed to seek answers from the Department of Correctional Services after his funeral this week. The last time we spoke he was crying and sounded weak. He was complaining of coughing-up blood. I couldn't promise to visit him this week, but when I asked him why he did not see a doctor, he told me the warders would not allow him to, said Carstens.She said Stemmet's fellow inmates had told the family of his death in prison before the department officials. Another inmate told us that during a raid a cellphone was found in his possession. Crying, he told us how Isroedien was beaten and sprayed with a hose by warders, who knew knew he had TB, said Carstens.She said she felt guilt at not going to see Stemmet and would take legal action to find out what really happened. They told us he died from TB, but his face was badly beaten and there was so much blood. We were also told during the night he was suffering and prisoners were ignored, trying to get the warders attention to visit the cell.&quot;Isroedien was dead the next morning and they are to blame, because they were negligent and denied him medical care, said Carstens.More than 8 900 inmates are squashed into the facility, built for only 3 900.Acting prison spokesperson Carla Williams said the department was inquiring into the incident and awaiting feedback.[email&#160;protected]
