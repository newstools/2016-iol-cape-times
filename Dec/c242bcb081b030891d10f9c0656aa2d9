THE reshuffle of the DA shadow cabinet in Gauteng was geared towards maximising the party s support in the strategic province ahead of the national elections in 2019.The party is already in charge of two of the province s three metros Tshwane and Joburg following the municipal elections in August.The DA is hoping to take over the country s richest province during the national and provincial elections in three years time. Yesterday, DA Gauteng leader John Moodey announced a reshuffle of the shadow cabinet, where Mike Moriarty was released of his other duties to allow him to continue serving as the party s chief whip in the provincial legislature. His previous position as shadow finance minister was taken up by DA member of the provincial legislature (MPL) Adriana Randall.DA Gauteng North regional chairperson Fred Nel was moved from the co-operative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta) portfolio to roads and transport as the portfolio s shadow MEC. Mervyn Cirota was appointed the new Cogta shadow MEC.The DA MPLs retaining their portfolios include Kate Lorimer (community safety), Janet Semple (economic development), Khume Ramulifho (education), Jack Bloom (health), Alan Fuchs (infrastructure development), Refiloe Nt sekhe (social development) and Kingsol Chabalala (sport, recreation, arts and culture).Former DA MP and now MPL Makashule Gana told The Star the changes were geared towards the 2019 elections. We want to maximise our support and governance going forth. No one was demoted, no one received the chop. We don t demote people. Those who were shadow MECs between 2014 and now were moved to other committees and legislative functions. Remember, not all committees have MECs, he noted.Moodey said: This reshuffle comes as a result of careful deliberations to strengthen our oversight role in the legislature as the DA readies itself to govern Gauteng after the 2019 national and provincial elections. The new-look team was well suited to hold Premier David Makhura and the provincial government to account.@luyolomkentane
