ACTOR Siv Ngesi has been an active participant of the RCS Gugs Race since it began. He is a passionate runner and a man who has Guguletu at heart.The Cape Times spoke to Ngesi about the significance of this years race.Will you be running the RCS Gugs Race 10km run this year? For how many years have you been participating?Sadly, this will be the first one I will miss since it began. This year I am working in Bali. I am a proud Gugs boy and I will always run this race, it means so much to the locals. As one of the country s foremost actors, how do you find the time to run the race every year?You don t find time, you make time for important things! Do you set yourself a personal goal each year for completing the race? What was your time last year?Without goals, you shouldn t bother doing anything in life last year my time was 45 minutes. Do you rope in any friends and family to run the race with you? Who will it be this year?My entire family runs this race, I always make sure all my celebrity friends join me on this special day my goal is always to beat them (but don t tell them). Do you think the RCS Gugs Race benefits the township of Gugs? How and why, please?This race is huge for my old neighbourhood, speak to all the kids who get sweets handed to them while runners pass them by, it s like an early Christmas. I think it s important for Capetonians to see how others live. I think it s great that Gugs can show off that it can organise a safe and flawless event my highlight race of the South African races. Do you have any personal ties to Gugs? My blood is pure Gugs blood, my family are pure Gugs people, my heart will always be in Gugs and I m a proud Gugs running club memberWhat do you love most about the RCS Gugs Race? The unity, the children running next to us while we run by (makes me feel like my hero Ali) and I love seeing everyone watching in their pyjamas.
