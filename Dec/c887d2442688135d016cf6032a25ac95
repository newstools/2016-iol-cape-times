Among women who do, most look to family and friends and very few look to formal institutions and mechanisms, such as police and health services. Less than 10 percent of those women seeking help for experience of violence sought help by appealing to the police.The country s campaign includes getting men to challenge the perpetrators of violence to change their behaviour to involve men in helping to eradicate violence and to provide survivors with information on services and organisations that can help lessen the impact of violence on their lives.&nbsp;The campaign ends on December 10, International Human Rights Day.&nbsp;
