A draft framework to improve teaching of mathematics at schools has been produced at a three-day indaba, the Department of Basic Education (DBE) said on Thursday.The indaba was concluded in Pretoria on Thursday. Teams led by the maths, science and technology ministerial task team will now take over work done and bring it to its conclusion with an informed way forward for South African mathematics education. This team of experts will work in consultation with other key stakeholders in carrying this task forward, the department said.DBE Minister Angie Motshekga has given the task team a year to complete its work and present the final mathematics framework, expected in December of 2017.The department said the purpose of the indaba was to develop a content knowledge outlook that would assist in the the teaching and learning of mathematics, the inclusion of assessments into teaching and learning, writing of mathematics textbooks and continuous training for maths teachers. Through the indaba, the Basic Education Department sought to solicit the intellectual views and expertise from reputable mathematics education practitioners and researchers to contribute to the conceptualisation of the envisaged mathematics pedagogical identity. This week, Motshekga decried the poor state of maths teaching in the country, and added that teachers lacked knowledge of the maths curriculum they taught.She recently came under fire for the decision to condone pupils who did not meet the requisite maths requirements for progression to the next grade in the senior phase grades 7 to 9. The department lowered the pass mark for maths to 20 percent in order to condone affected pupils who could not attain the 40 percent pass mark.The department said if a pupil failed a language they would fail the year, but said they could fail athematics and still pass and go to the next grade. To get a pass mark in languages and other subjects, a pupil must score 40 percent and above. African News Agency
