THE City of Cape Town s Environmental Health department has warned entrepreneurs and the public to avoid selling food without the proper permissions.Yesterday the City said Environmental Health practitioners had noticed in recent weeks the increase in the number of people selling cooked food from their car boots during the early hours.Mayco member for Health, Siyabulela Mamkeli, said: We do not want to be the Grinch that steals people s entrepreneurial spirit, but we have a duty to protect the public. There are laws around the preparation and transportation of food that city health has to enforce. We cannot turn a blind eye as that would not be fair to legal traders or the public in the event that someone gets sick. Food preparation is difficult enough as it is, but with the summer months upon us, the risk of food spoiling is so much higher. According to the City, the regulations on general hygiene requirements for food premises and transport of food stipulate appropriate and acceptable premises, maintenance of good hygiene practices including personal hygiene of all food handlers, cold chain maintenance, effective food storage practices, maintenance of food at safe temperatures as prescribed in the legislation, safe and hygienic working environments when preparing and serving food, and measures to prevent contamination of food.The city s environmental health practitioners run routine inspections of food premises to make sure the standards are adhered to. Shortcomings are observed and brought the attention of management by means of an inspection report, along with a specific time frame in which they are to be addressed.Fines can range from R1 000 to R2 000.
