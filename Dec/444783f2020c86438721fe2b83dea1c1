Western Cape police have arrested two further suspects who are believed to be behind the recent attack which left a female Cape Town police officer dead and her colleague seriously injured.Directorate for Priority Crime investigation (Hawks) spokesman Captain Lloyd Ramovha said Thabo Nohashe, 23, and Bronwen Bandile Qongqo, 26, made a brief appearance at the Athlone Magistrate s Court on Tuesday in connection with the murder of Constable Amanda Ladlokova and the wounding of her colleague last month.The arrests, which took place in Philippi and Mitchells Plain on Sunday, brings to three the number of suspects arrested in connection with the attack. Ashwin Kennedy, 19, was the first suspect to be arrested shortly after the attack which took place on November 22.According to the police, Ladlokova and her colleague had just finished serving a protection order in Philippi when they were approached with a similar complaint nearby. On their way to assist, they were allegedly ambushed by three armed suspects who shot them at close range, killing Ladlokova instantly, while the colleague, a sergeant, survived the ordeal and was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Nohashe and Qongqo were arrested by a multi-disciplinary team consisting of the Hawks and SAPS Public Order members on Sunday in Philippi and Mitchells Plain respectively, bringing the total number of suspects arrested to three. Hawks national head Lieutenant-General Mthandazo Ntlemeza lauded the investigating team for the swift arrests. We are serious about fighting crime. We can never rest when the defenders of the rule of law are mercilessly killed, we would also like to extend our gratitude to members of the community for the credible information supplied, let us continue to work together in defending innocent citizens and uphold the constitution of this country. The three accused are expected to appear again in the Athlone Magistrate s Court on January 3, 2017 for bail application. African News Agency
