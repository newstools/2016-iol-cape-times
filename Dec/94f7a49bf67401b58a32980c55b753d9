THE woman accused of hiring a hitman to kill her husband had her R30 000 bail reinstated, but her bail conditions were tightened, a move her legal representative William Booth welcomed.This was despite the State asking the court to increase her bail to R50 000.Petina Coetzee, 44, is accused of of approaching a colleague to arrange her husband s murder for R200 000.Last Thursday, a warrant was issued for Coetzee s arrest after she failed to report to court and broke her bail conditions. Prosecutor Christian de Jongh yesterday told the court police went looking for her almost two weeks ago but could not find her, and were told she was on holiday. The police say it is difficult to find the accused at her address. It is difficult tracing her. But magistrate Goolam Bawa said: If the accused is not under house arrest, she cannot be waiting (at the house) for police to come. De Jongh told Bawa that Coetzee had also contacted her husband, Austin Coetzee, on December 2, a contravention of her bail conditions after she was ordered not to. Coetzee was not allowed to leave the Western Cape or change her address without consent. She must report at the Elsies River police station every Friday, ruled Bawa. The magistrate said an increase of the bail amount would serve no purpose .The case was postponed until February 21. [email&#160;protected]
