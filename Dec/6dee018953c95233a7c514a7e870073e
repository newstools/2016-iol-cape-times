THE Black Land First (BLF) movement has called for the national shutdown of universities in protest against the proposed fee increases and in support of the demand for free higher education when tertiary institutions reopen next year.Several universities last week announced fee increases of 8 percent, nearly three months after Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande announced that universities could determine their own fee increases for 2017, but that the increase should not exceed 8 percent.Nzimande also announced that students from households with an annual income totalling up to R600 000 would not have to pay the increases.The increase was made despite protests at various universities across the country demanding free education, with the increase rejected by student representative councils.Addressing the BLF movement s national strategic planning meeting in Durban, the movement's convener, Andile Mngxitama, said the fee increase was uncalled for and that students should be supported when they demand free tertiary education next year. Free education is possible only if there is a national shutdown. We must support a national shutdown, comrades, Mngxitama told his audience.He accused the authorities of announcing the fee increases when students were finishing writing their exams. Next year, again, we are in the trenches, with students in a national shutdown for free education, Mngxitama said.He also said their movement supported the announcement that the government was ready to pay compensation for the victims of the Marikana massacre.
