TABLE Mountain was lit up with a laser display at the weekend to mark 20 years since South Africa s Constitution was signed into law.Hundreds of people joined Department of Justice officials on Tafelberg Road to witness the display.Western Cape Justice Department head Hishaam Mohamed said the light display was part of an education campaign to teach South Africans about their rights from now until Human Rights Day next March. People claim their rights; they must also read the constitution so they can say where they want it to be changed, said Mohamed.He said Justice Department staff would be doing outreach at malls over the festive season, and distributing special bookmarks which contain the Bill of Rights at six toll gates exiting and entering Gauteng.These bookmarks had already been distributed at 20 malls and taxi ranks over the past three days.
