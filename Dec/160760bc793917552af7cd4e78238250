NO ROADWORKS were scheduled for the coming holiday period on the N1 between Gauteng and Cape Town and road users would not experience major delays, the SA National Roads Agency said yesterday. Extreme high volumes of traffic were, however, expected in parts of the Karoo and at the Huguenot Tunnel on certain days prior to public holidays, Sanral spokesperson Vusi Mona said. The automated payment system introduced last year by Sanral at toll plazas in southern Gauteng Grasmere, Verkeerdevlei and the Vaal brought major benefits for road users with electronic tags who no longer had to stop at the booms. The system recognises the tag on the vehicle, and the boom is lifted, enabling the vehicle to drive through without coming to a complete stop. This is one of the new technologies introduced by Sanral to make long-distance journeys safer and more comfortable, Mona said. It cuts down on the waiting times at toll booths, reduces driver fatigue and frustration, and contributes to a much more pleasant journey.&quot;Sanral expected free-flowing traffic throughout December and January on the entire N1 route. High traffic volumes would be experienced on the weekend and on the days prior to the Day of Reconciliation, Christmas and New Year. . Road users in the Joburg area should also be aware of the urban roadworks undertaken by the municipality and should be cautious at detours, especially at night, Mona added.
