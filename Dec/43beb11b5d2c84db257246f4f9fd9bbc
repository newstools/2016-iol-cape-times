CLARKE S bar and dining room will close its doors come Monday for its staff and members of a group of diners, removed from the establishment after being allegedly racially abused by a patron, to meet. The Bree Street restaurant came under fire for its handling of an alleged racially motivated attack on some of its customers on Friday. According to reviews left on Clarke s Facebook page, a group of friends were dining when a woman approached their table and asked them if everyone here is black , and called them common coloureds . They asked management to remove the woman, but were apparently removed from the restaurant themselves after the situation escalated. In a second apology, after the first had been slated as insincere, owner Lyndall Maunder said yesterday: I d like to say sorry. The event on Friday and what followed has woken me up to how disconnected I am, and my perception of the world I live in has been permanently changed. I have been talking to so many different people about what this is, and trying to find answers, but I still have no idea what to do. The colour of my skin means I don t have the experience or history to clearly understand. But I m asking as many questions as I can and opening up my world as much as I can. She said Clarke s will close its doors for the day and all its staff and the group will be invited to help find ways to move forward. The apology again, however, did not find favour on social media. Siyamthanda Witbooi commented: I was planning on going to your restaurant tomorrow with friends, but I wouldn t want to eat in a space that s anti-black. Just kick racists out.You re disappointing. Mahmood Randeree said: Once again, an opportunity to acknowledge and deal with racism at Clarke s has been missed. Racism is unacceptable and should be combated whenever it sticks out its ugly head. Deal with it, if a lesson has been really learned.
