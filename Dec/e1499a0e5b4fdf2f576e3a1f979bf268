LOW rainfall and water shortages continue to plague the Western Cape, with trouble now brewing for Oudtshoorn and Uniondale in the Klein Karoo as well. Agri Western Cape chief executive Carl Opperman yesterday said the areas experienced very little rainfall during the winter, and producers had sold bales of feed for cash flow.They are now left with a situation where they have none available for themselves.Southern Africa has been affected by a severe drought that has prompted water restrictions by various municipalities, which have warned that water could be rationed if consumers do not heed calls to cut consumption.It brought scorching temperatures, with 2015 being the driest year in South Africa since records began in 1904, impacting farmers and pushing up food prices.Two irrigation dams in the Klein Karoo, the Kammanassie and the Stompdrift dams, were respectively 11 percent and 13 percent full, Opperman said.Producers in Nelspoort and Murraysburg in the Central Karoo were also in dire need of drought assistance. These areas usually got good rain, but very little rain had fallen to date, Opperman said. Warm winds were also drying out the already limited available pastures. The West Coast and Central Karoo districts have been declared drought disaster areas and received below-average rainfall again this year,&quot; he said. &quot;Farm dams in these areas are empty and livestock producers will need feed critically during the summer months ahead.&quot;.Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde said in his mid-year budget speech earlier this month that additional funding was reallocated to emerging farmers for drought relief.In agriculture, about R25 million was reallocated to drought relief, which brought the province s total to R61 million over the past year. As yields failed to materialise in some parts, it became clear many would struggle to cover the costs of operations. We are determined to walk the road with our emerging farmers to ensure their enterprises grow into thriving agri-businesses, Winde said.He said an evaluation of drought conditions in districts was under way to determine where additional drought aid support might be needed.
