ONE of the four men accused of the rape and murder of Kalk Bay teenager Franziska Bl&ouml;chliger in the Tokai forest earlier this year will only know next month if he will be released on bail.The four men appeared in the Wynberg District Court yesterday before Magistrate Momina Ismail. Because the charges include rape, they may not be named until their trial commences in the Western Cape High Court.The purpose of the hearing was two-fold: for one of the men to explain his absence on Tuesday, December&nbsp;6, and for lawyer Monique Carstens to file written reasons why her client s release on bail was in the interests of justice. Lawyer Mogammad Galant, representing the accused who failed to appear in court on December&nbsp;6, told the court his client had been ill, but had in fact come to court in any event that day to be told by court officials to return the next day.Galant s client was present at those proceedings, and his explanation was accepted by prosecutor Phumeza Mtuyedwa-Zondi.Two of the men are already out on R1&nbsp;000 bail each.The third is serving a jail sentence in another unrelated case, and the fourth will know on January&nbsp;18 whether he is to be released on bail.At the December&nbsp;6 proceedings, those in attendance were each handed a copy of the High Court indictment, detailing charges of murder, rape and robbery with aggravating circumstances.At the bail proceedings in which two of the men were released on bail, the magistrate commented: This is one of the most violent and heinous cases that I have ever presided over in my time. She said she sympathised with members of the community, and understood why they did not want the men released on bail.But she added: The court cannot lose sight of the principle that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Franziska, who was 16 years old, was found dead in the Tokai Forest on March&nbsp;7 about 200m from the place in the forest where she and her mother had agreed to meet after she had gone for a jog at a popular recreation spot.
