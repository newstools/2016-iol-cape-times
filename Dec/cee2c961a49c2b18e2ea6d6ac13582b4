They won all their games leading up to the final of the Cape Town Sevens, but the Blitzboks will have to revisit their depth for the rest of the World Sevens Series.After thrashing Wales 33-0 in the Cup quarter-final and New Zealand 14-7 in the semifinal on Sunday, the Springbok Sevens had to do without star winger Seabelo Senatla and former captain Kyle Brown in the title decider against England due to injury.Senatla was on the bench but wasn t fit enough to come on, while Brown hurt his knee and watched the final on crutches from the sidelines.Their absence was felt by the Blitzboks in the high-pressure situation of a final as the South Africans missed a few try-scoring opportunities and slipped a couple of tackles in a 19-17 defeat.Most importantly, they lost their composure in the final play of the game with the score being 19-12 in favour of England. A high tackle on Rosko Specman saw England s Dan Norton given a yellow card and South Africa receiving a penalty five metres from the tryline.They needed to ensure that they scored the try close to the uprights to make the conversion easier, which was needed to take the game into extra-time at 19-19.Instead, Werner Kok placed the ball over the line in the far left-hand corner, which made it virtually impossible for Justin Geduld to goal the conversion. He missed his kick to the left of the uprights, and England had dethroned the Blitzboks of their Cape Town title.The leadership of Brown and game-breaking abilities of Senatla was certainly missed in the final, but coach Neil Powell will have to find a replacement for Senatla soon as the flyer will play his last two sevens tournaments in Wellington and Sydney early next year before joining the Stormers in Super Rugby.Speedy loose forward Kwagga Smith is also leaving the Blitzboks after the Sydney Sevens on February 4-5 as he will link up with the Lions in the 15-man game.Smith was outstanding in the final against England and brought great energy to the Bok Sevens side in the second half.Siviwe Soyizwapi was brought into the squad for the final as a replacement for Brown but didn t make it on to the field.Powell will have to give the pacy Soyizwapi some game time in the next two tournaments to prepare for life after Senatla, with Specman the man likely to take his place in the starting line-up in future.
