An exhibition about the soon-to-depart Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE) is taking shape at the V&amp;A Waterfront ahead of its opening on Thursday morning.Visitors to the House of Switzerland exhibition, celebrating the three-month expedition, will get a preview of how this Swiss-funded expedition will expand knowledge about the largely unknown region that plays a crucial role in regulating the world s climate.The exhibition which is next to the Swing Bridge at the V&amp;A will run until December 20, the day the expedition sets off from Cape Town.ACE is composed of 22 projects and brings together research teams from six continents. The projects focus on different areas of study, all of which are fundamental for a better understanding of Antarctica s ecosystems.The projects, which were chosen from more than 100 submissions, include mapping and monitoring threatened species such as Southern Ocean whales, albatrosses and penguins, a study into what happens after the calving of a giant iceberg and another designed to uncover the mystery of the ocean s false bottom .The House of Switzerland exhibition, which is being assembled in containers at the V&amp;A, will give visitors a glimpse of the work from biology to climatology to oceanography to be undertaken by 50 scientists as they circumnavigate Antarctica on the Russian research vessel, the Akademik Treshnikov.The exhibition, which is free to members of the public, will also showcase the Swiss spirit of innovation and Switzerland s contribution to polar research.The Akademik Treshnikov arrives in Cape Town on Thursday carrying 50 young scientists from around the world who will have attended an onboard university for a month. They were selected to take part in the ACE Maritime University, which has been conducted under the auspices of the Russian Geographic Society on board the vessel since departure from Bremerhaven in Germany on November 19.In addition to the House of Switzerland exhibition, various cultural events will be held during the weekend of December 17 and 18 to celebrate the expedition. One highly anticipated event is a concert by the Alphorn artist Eliana Burki, who is known for having developed the concept funky Swiss Alphorn , at 6.30pm on Saturday next to the House of Switzerland.ACE is the first project of the Swiss Polar Institute, a newly created public private partnership that aims to enhance international relations and collaboration between countries on Antarctica. It also hopes to spark the interest of a new generation of young scientists and explorers in polar research. African News Agency
