A KHAYELITSHA dancer who brought an audience in Sydney, Australia, to their feet with his stellar performance died after being stabbed several times during a suspected robbery in Site B. Yanga Jadezweni was found in an alleyway metres from his home after he was involved in an altercation with the suspects, who are believed to have followed him on Friday. The 21-year-old senior dancer at Indoni Dance, Arts &amp; Leadership Academy (Idala) had just returned from a successful tour of Australia. The academy yesterday said it had been told a suspect was arrested in connection with Jadezweni s murder. Condolences continued pouring in for Jadezweni s family. The academy is planning to have a special award named after him. Jadezweni s death came a week after two of his fellow dancers based in Gugulethu were also attacked. One of them, Sonwabile Mhlonyane, has a punctured lung from a stab wound and is recovering in hospital. Yesterday, Idala co-founder Sbonakaliso Ndaba said: It was and still is devastating as I had to break the news to the crew. We had to cancel the show and immediately visit his family. Prayers were said with them. Ndaba described Jadezweni as a bright dancer who had a promising career ahead of him. This has hurt me. I can feel the pain his parents are going through. &quot;He was one of the people who were clued up. As a person he blew me away with his talent the first time I met him. He was someone who knew and loved what he was doing. It's difficult losing such a promising young star. We are like a family. Idala co-founder Balu Nivison said: We are devastated beyond words at this tragic, wasted, beautiful life. He touched the hearts and souls of all with his energetic gifted singing and exceptional dancing. Police did not respond before deadline.
