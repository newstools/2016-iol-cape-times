Parliament - The continued death threats aimed at South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) journalists who testified during a parliamentary inquiry into the affairs of the broadcaster was a direct assault on Parliament, MPs said on Wednesday. &quot;We reiterate our call to the crime-fighting agencies to assist and ensure that all witnesses appearing before the inquiry are protected,&quot; said Vincent Smith, chairman of the ad hoc committee conducting the inquiry, in a statement.&nbsp; &quot;We condemn any attempt to subvert accountability to Parliament.&quot;&nbsp; The statement came after United Democratic Movement (UDM) MP Nqabayomzi Kwankwa informed MPs of the threat, reading out one SMS message a journalist received.&nbsp; &quot;Traitors protecting your white friends in Parliament who started this, telling lies about your comrades. You are warned, we don't kill blacks but sit and watch the blood flow,&quot; the SMS said, according to Kwankwa.&nbsp; Smith said the committee viewed the threats in a serious light and had offered to raise the matter with parliamentary authorities. &quot;The Committee is seriously worried that the management of SABC seems unaware of this life-threatening situation faced by the journalists, following board chairperson's testimony yesterday where he told the Committee that he didn't know about the threats,&quot; the statement said.&nbsp; On Monday, journalists Thembeka Gqubule, Krivani Pillay, Lukhanyo Calata and Vuyo Mvoko gave harrowing testimony about Hlaudi Motsoeneng, the man who went from an ordinary producer for a Free State current affairs show to top management at the broadcaster, allegedly because he received protection from &quot;Pretoria&quot;.&nbsp; The journalists were fired earlier this year for objecting openly to censorship, as well as the manipulation and distortion of the news.&nbsp; Many have since been reinstated, but claim they continue to be intimidated and receive threats. Motsoeneng, the journalists testified on Monday, had wrought a &quot;reign of terror&quot; over the newsroom, insisting on news policies which included the banning of airing footage of violent service delivery protests, a decision the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa later ordered the broadcaster to withdraw.&nbsp; African News Agency
