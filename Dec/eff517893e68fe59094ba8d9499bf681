INSPIRED by a Cape Times article advising readers to become more active, Patricia Demas s idea of lockers to hold personal items while engaging in physical activities claimed first prize in the inaugural Cape Times Innovation Awards. The mother of two from Southfield won a business plan from Grant Thornton, Standard Bank s Incubator programme valued at R75&nbsp;000, R10&nbsp;000 cash and a two-hour mentoring session with award-winning entrepreneur Charles Maisel. This particular (competition) is so close to what I do every day. I teach business studies at Bergvliet High School and constantly try to motivate and inspire my learners to think creatively and be entrepreneurs and not employees. As part of the subject I peruse the newspaper daily to add relevance to what I teach, she said. Demas is a deputy principal at Bergvliet. Speaking of the story that inspired her idea, people were being encouraged to do more physical activity as part of World Diabetes Day, she said last year she decided to acquire a motorbike. She would reach a destination and have no place to put her helmet and jacket. Similar to the small postboxes to be found at malls or various public places, lockers big enough to hold a jacket and helmet could be installed for not only motorcyclists but anyone else (cyclists, walkers, runners, surfers or beachgoers) simply needing to offload some bulky stuff while getting some exercise. These lockers would need to be in a public space that has reasonable security measures in place. The lockers could be operated with a swipe card, purchased at various malls/supermarkets, thereby eliminating the potential hazard of theft when coins are used. She said the win was a fantastic way to end her 50th birthday year by being funded by Standard Bank to get her concept off the ground. Other finalists were Crystal van Der Pohll, Derrik Levy, Makabongwe Metuso, Saneeya Adams, Patrick Rukondo, Amina Loonat and Dilshaad Dalvie, Micheal Schuchardt and Linda Landry.
