COMMUTERS have mixed feelings on Golden Arrow s 4.45 percent fare increase from December 26.Company spokesperson Bronwen Dyke said the pending fare increase was discussed with their passenger forums, which have acknowledged the transparent and timeous engagement. In terms of the provision, GABS has by mutual agreement with the Western Cape Department of Transport and Public Works been allowed to implement a 4.45 percent increase which will come into effect as from Monday December 26, Dyke said.But Nomanesi Kwetu from Khayelitsha said it was news to her that fares will increase. If I was informed that fares would increase I would have objected. I am already paying more than R500 a month. How much am I going to pay now? she said.Gugulethu s Mawonga Makunga of Gugulethu said unlike taxis, Golden Arrow did not often increase fares, so it was fair.Defending the increase, Dyke said Golden Arrow procured 74 new buses and an automated-fare collection system at a total of R204 million in the past financial year.Passengers can postpone paying the new fares until January 6 in the case of 10-ride clipcards, and until January 29 for monthly clipcards, if purchased on December 24.
