ONLY a cruel, callous, calculated coward would commit the crimes Jerome Amerika did, Western Cape High Court Judge Robert Henney said yesterday as he sentenced the kidnapper, rapist, and murderer to five life sentences.Amerika, 23, kidnapped and raped his ex-girlfriend, who cannot be named, and kidnapped, raped, and murdered her 10-year-old relative, Shamonique Claasen.Amerika and his former lover had dated since 2013, and despite several breakups she kept taking him back.Judge Henney said the ex-lover showed signs of battered woman syndrome, and the case was unique because many instances involving domestically abused women do not end in a trial.The State decided to pursue the case, despite her not wanting to press charges. Claasen went missing from her Paarl home in February, just a day before her 11th birthday.Two days later a family member found her decomposing body wrapped in plastic hidden under a bed.Amerika had kidnapped, raped, smothered and strangled the little girl. It has almost become a daily occurrence in this country of ours that young children are brutally murdered after they had been sexually abused in a violent manner. &quot;It is something that has to come to a stop sooner rather than later, Judge Henney said.During sentencing, Amerika showed no emotion and smirked as he was escorted to the cells. Society demands that wanton criminal acts be punished. It demands of the courts to send out a clear and staring message that such acts of criminality will not be countenanced and further demands that the strictest and severest punishment should be meted out, Judge Henney said.Praises from the public gallery were sung for Judge Henney from all Claasen s relatives following sentencing.Claasen s mother Magdaline said she was happy with the sentence although nothing would heal her wounds. Thank you to Judge Henney for bringing justice, she said. [email&#160;protected]
