Our tumultuous socio-economic climate has made many of us cynical about believing any, if not all, social change claims.&quot;However, over the course of Independent Media s 'reboot', there is a clear timeline indicating its intentions.&quot;And it clearly says we are agents of social change and unapologetic about it. In the true spirit of reconciliation, participants from all over will tackle the 10km or 4km race.The 10km route starts at NY 3 from 7am.It will take runners by the iconic Gugulethu 7 and the Amy Biehl memorials and end at the Gugulethu Stadium in NY 49.Along the way participants will pass the Gugulethu Square and the Nyanga Junction Shopping Centres.The two landmarks are the results of pioneering Gugulethu businesspeople, Mzoli Ngcawuzele and Zithulele Kk Combi.Partnering with the Gugulethu Reconciliation Race is a significant step for the Cape Times.Over the past three years the Cape Times has consciously remade itself, from a newspaper which served a few, to one that is a voice for all.Editor Aneez Salie says: The Cape Times is a newspaper that seeks to build bridges within and between communities, giving a voice to those who had been silenced and mostly ignored for decades.&quot;We re a voice for all.&quot;That is why we re delighted and honoured to be part of this Reconciliation Race. &quot;This year, the Cape Times has embarked on a strategy to reach out to its various readership communities.&quot;This included hosting a series of Breakfast Meetings in readership communities, including Khayelitsha and Lansdowne, as well as the Atlantic seaboard.&quot;Being the official media partner of this event, which is located in Gugulethu and which reaches out directly to the local community, as well as its broader readership base, is in line with the outreach strategy.&quot;According to the latest All Media and Products Survey (AMPS), 78 percent of the readership of the Cape Times is black (African, Coloured and Indian) and 45 percent of the readership fall within the 9-10 Living Standards Measure and 37 percent are within the 7-8 LSM.
