AN EIGHTH suspect has been arrested in connection with the gang-rape of a 13-year-old Nyanga girl, allegedly by 10 men.The 18-year-old was arrested on Wednesday night following a manhunt.He joined seven other suspects, aged between 18 and 20, who have been in custody since November 16. They are all expected to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate s Court on rape charges today. Police spokesperson Andr&eacute; Traut said the police could not pre-empt what would happen in court but their primary function was to secure a conviction.The girl s family said she did not receive counselling for almost a week after the incident. The teenager informed her ailing grandmother that one of the suspects held her at gunpoint on the evening of Friday, November 11 and forced her into a shack, where she was repeatedly raped. She was taken to two other shacks.The family said she was held for three nights before being released on Monday, November 14. Yesterday, community leaders lauded the breakthrough, but urged the police to bring the remaining two suspects to book. Nyanga Community Policing Forum chairperson Martin Makhasi said: As much as we welcome the recent arrest, we would be much happier when the remaining two suspects are arrested. We would be very disappointed if those children (suspects) are granted bail. The case caused outrage, with President Jacob Zuma saying he was shocked. He directed the minister of Social Development and the police to intervene. A number of Cape Times readers also came forward and offered to assist the girl with counselling. The teenager has since been kept in a place of safety. Resident Sithandiwe Dingana said: Police are making progress. We are hoping that by the time the case goes on trial, all the suspects would be in custody to face the consequences.
