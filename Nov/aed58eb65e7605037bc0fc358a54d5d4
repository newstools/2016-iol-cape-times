REFORMS approved by the cabinet for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) would give them &#x201C;shock absorbers&#x201D; to protect them from &#x201C;undue influence from outside&#x201D;, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said &#x2028;yesterday.His comments in the National Council of Provinces during a question-and-answer session came a week after the release of former &#x2028;public protector Thuli Madonsela&apos;s report on state capture detailed the proximity of Eskom board members to the Gupta family and the utility&#x2019;s apparent role in helping them fund the purchase of a coal mine previously owned by Glencore.The cabinet approved the &#x201C;broad thrust&#x201D; of a framework for the appointment of boards and executive officers of state-owned enterprises at its meeting last week, along with a guideline for remuneration and incentives, and a private sector participation framework for infrastructure delivery.While no details were provided on how boards and management of parastatals would be insulated from the kind of undue influence highlighted in the &#x201C;State of Capture&#x201D; report, Ramaphosa said the reforms would ensure that whatever &#x201C;dynamics&#x201D; were at play outside the SOEs would not &#x201C;unduly affect&#x201D; them.He said the government wanted them to follow &#x2028;principles of good corporate governance procedures and rules, and he believed the reforms would offer the best standards. The parastatals should be run by people of integrity and &#x201C;not be influenced and blow like a candle in the wind&#x201D;, Ramaphosa said.A meeting scheduled for earlier in the day for the Treasury to brief the public enterprises oversight committee on its concerns with Eskom and Denel was postponed, but the public protector&#x2019;s report detailed how Eskom had first squeezed the Optimum coal mine into business rescue and then prepaid Gupta firm Tegeta R600 million for coal supplied before it took ownership.The decision to make the prepayment was mysteriously made on the night Tegeta&#x2019;s banks rejected a request to cover a shortfall of a similar amount towards funding the acquisition.It also recorded how Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe was in regular contact with Ajay Gupta in the months before the deal was concluded.Ramaphosa said the interministerial committee on state-owned enterprises, which he chairs, was &#x201C;tracking them on an ongoing basis&#x201D;. The reforms were intended to shore up those in difficulty and prevent them from requiring further capital injections or loan guarantees.To ensure they made contributions to the country, there would have to be clarity on which SOEs should play a developmental role and which should &#x201C;churn out profit and dividends to the nation&#x201D;.Ramaphosa said &#x201C;quite a few are going to come &#x2028;right soon&#x201D;.
