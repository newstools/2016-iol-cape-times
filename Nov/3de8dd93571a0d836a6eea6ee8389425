ESKOM says its capacity expansion programme is on track.&#x201C;One of the highlights when Eskom released its integrated results for six months was the significant progress on the new build programme with Ingula&#x2019;s units 4, 2 and 1 having been in commercial operation since June 10, August 22, and August 30 respectively, adding 999MW of peaking capacity, Eskom said.The remaining unit at Ingula, unit 3, was synchronised to the grid on October 29 after repairs were completed.The unit was on track for commercial operation by 2017.Unit 6 of the new Medupi Power Station in Limpopo had been in commercial operation since August 2015.Unit 5 was synchronised to the national grid on September 8.The synchronisation of unit 5 marked a key milestone towards the full commercial operation of the unit ahead of its scheduled commercial operation in March 2018.Good progress was also being made on unit 4 of the Medupi project, Eskom said.The new Kusile Power Station in Mpumalanga was also making significant strides.Unit 1 continued to achieve set milestones on the path to commercial operation by the second half of 2018.Key milestones achieved included the completion of the chemical clean in August and first fire using oil in September.The Kusile project mechanically completed and commissioned the first wet flue gas desulphurisation, thereby being the first to install the technology, not only in South Africa, but the continent of Africa.Unit 2 was progressing well.The project completed hydro-testing of the unit 2 boiler on October 1, which would positively influence the achievement of boiler registration.&#x201C;On the transmission side, 53km of lines have been installed and 1050MVA transformers have been commissioned for electricity transmission.&quot;We remain focused on bringing new capacity online with 9&#x2005;104MW to be commissioned over the next six years,&#x201D; Eskom added.
