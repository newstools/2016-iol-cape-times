WOODSTOCK residents who face eviction from their homes rejected the City of Cape Town&#x2019;s offer to move to a &#x201C;temporary resettlement area&#x201D; 35km north of the city centre, which is plagued by drugs, TB and unemployment.In the City&#x2019;s responding affidavit, challenged by a group of tenants from Bromwell Street in Woodstock, they were offered accommodation at the Wolwe Rivier &#x201C;incremental development area&#x201D; near Melkbosstrand.Yesterday, after several residents visited the area for the first time, they rejected it, with one saying that she would rather sleep on the streets than move to an area with no facilities or amenities.Their case is scheduled to be heard in the Western Cape High Court on Wednesday.The owners of their homes, Woodstock Hub, sought their eviction since July when they were handed an eviction order, but residents cried foul, saying they had nowhere to go in an area which had become increasingly gentrified.Daphne, who did not want to use her last name, described Wolve Rivier as &#x201C;shocking&#x201D;.&#x201C;There&apos;s no life there. There&apos;s unemployment and you can&apos;t access employment opportunities.&#x201D;She works in Salt River, an easy distance from Bromwell Street, but said she had no idea how those who would move to Wolwe Rivier were expected to go to their jobs.&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got a child in primary school and (I) take medication for high blood pressure.&#x201C;Wolwe Rivier is far from everything; we don&#x2019;t know how to access public transport.&#x201D;Wolwe Rivier resembled a ghost town when the Cape Times team visited the area yesterday.With tumble-weeds rolling through the area, the only signs of life there were a few children playing outside.Daphne said she didn&apos;t take long to make up her mind after visiting the area for the first time yesterday.&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not moving there, I would rather sit on the pavement.&#x201D;Another Bromwell Street tenant, George Rodrigues, described Wolwe Rivier as &#x201C;dead&#x201D; and in &#x201C;the middle of nowhere&#x201D;.&#x201C;There&apos;s no life there and no job opportunities. The kids who are there aren&apos;t in school.&#x201D;He said many tenants have been asked to apply for social housing and the City were only prepared to assist those who were unemployed.Charnelle Commando, who became a spokesperson for the tenants, said their gripe with Wolwe Rivier was the fact that it was far from the Cape Town city centre, where many residents were either employed, or could get employment opportunities.&#x201C;There are no amenities, no shops and no schools for the children. The only things there are a cr&#xE8;che and a mobile clinic which comes once a month &#x2013; and it&#x2019;s only for children.Benedicta van Minnen, Cape Town&apos;s mayoral committee member for human settlements, said several of the Bromwell Street tenants qualified for social and GAP housing.&#x201C;To those who don&apos;t qualify, we&apos;ve made them the offer of accommodation at Wolwe Rivier. It&#x2019;s up to them to make up their own minds.&#x201D; [email&#160;protected] @mtyala
