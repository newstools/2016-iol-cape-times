THE national Health Department has refuted claims that over 307 medical intern positions are in limbo due to provincial budget cuts.It says it has been working with provinces to address a shortfall of posts, and placements should be finalised at the end of this month.The Junior Doctors Association of SA (Judasa) had alleged more than 300 medical interns could be without work next year following budget cuts.Judasa provincial chairperson Dr Zahid Badroodien said out of about 1 700 interns that need placement in various hospitals from early next year, there was still no guarantee the 307 applicants who required placement would find spots.In a statement, the national Health Department said as the custodian of the newly implemented Internship Community Service Programme (ICSP) Online system, it has been working with provinces since July 2016 to quantify and address the shortfall of posts.Additional posts have been added throughout the application period as provinces have responded to this call.&#x201C;However, under the current fiscal conditions the process to fund more posts has taken some time. Notwithstanding this, the department is confident that provinces will by the end of November 2016 have sufficient funded posts to complete the 2017 placement,&#x201D; the department said.Judasa provincial chairperson Zahid Badroodien said the delay in placement and release of results by the department has caused immense emotional and psychological pressures on applicants, who do not know if they are employed or where they will be working in 2017.
