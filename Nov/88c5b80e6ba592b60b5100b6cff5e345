RESTORED head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) Robert McBride says systemic corruption in the SAPS will be his top priority now that he&apos;s back in the saddle.Last week, the National Prosecuting Authority dropped the charges against McBride relating to his alleged altering of an Ipid report on the rendition of Zimbabweans &#x2013; supposedly to protect former Hawks head Anwa Dramat and his Gauteng counterpart Shadrack Sibiya.McBride made his first appearance yesterday before Parliament&apos;s police oversight committee since his suspension more than a year ago by Police Minister Nathi Nhleko, and after the Constitutional Court set his suspension aside and Parliament declined the minister&apos;s request to subject McBride to a misconduct inquiry.He said after the meeting he had always been adamant there was no case for him to answer, and the dropping of the charges vindicated this view. &#x201C;The issue is, did our democracy work? Where there have been failures in one arm of governance, another arm will assist.&#x201C;In our case it was the courts, so the democracy works, and that&apos;s why the different elements of democracy are in place to ensure the checks and balances are kept and there isn&apos;t any abuse of power,&quot; McBride said.His &#x201C;most pressing concern&#x201D; now was Ipid&#x2019;s ability to take on complex systemic corruption problems.&#x201C;If we are able to deal with systemic corruption within SAPS, it sends a message because (the) most systemic corruption is carried out by senior members, and if we&apos;re able to effectively deal with that and eventually get prosecutions, it will send a message to the lower ranks, and you&apos;ll have a trickle-down effect of an improvement in ethics and integrity,&#x201D; McBride said.However, he would not be drawn on specific investigations, saying only that there was no &#x201C;ceiling, glass or otherwise&#x201D; on how far up his investigations could go. &#x201C;I must go without fear, favour or prejudice to wherever the investigation takes me.&#x201D;He said he would also be revisiting the restructuring initiated by Israel Kgamanyane, appointed by Nhleko in his place after his suspension, and was awaiting a handover report on the matter.&quot;What has happened in the past, we&apos;re going forward. We&#x2019;ve got work to do,&#x201D; McBride said.
