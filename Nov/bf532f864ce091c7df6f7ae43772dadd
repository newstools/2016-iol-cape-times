The two companies are showcasing objects connected to each other using Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT), a low power, wide area technology that can connect objects to the Internet of Things more efficiently, as a result of a stronger and more penetrative signal. MTN said on Wednesday: Connecting these devices to the internet by means of a mobile network is where NB-IoT comes into its own. MTN and Huawei signed an agreement to allow their collaboration, to happen at an exponential rate as both organisations are committed to an all-connected Africa .Michael Ma, president of Huawei Cloud Core's product line, said: We are very pleased to announce our strategic co-operation with MTN in the IoT field We look forward to a continuing close relationship with MTN to bring more IoT services to Africa.
