THE ANC has warned the Hawks to stay away from politics and focus on its mandate to fight crime and corruption after reports emerged yesterday that the unit was investigating party leaders Gwede Mantashe and Zweli Mkhize and Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas on state capture matters.Mantashe and Mkhize are reportedly being investigated for failing to report Ajay Gupta after Jonas claimed Gupta allegedly offered him a &#x2028;R600 million bribe.The national working committee of the ANC is expected to discuss this matter at its meeting in Luthuli House today.Yesterday, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa warned the Hawks to stay away from politics.He described the investigation into the party&apos;s top officials as frivolous.&#x201C;There is something nefarious about it,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;We would like to warn these state agencies, especially the Hawks, that they must not play into the political space because they will undermine their credibility.&#x201D;Mantashe and Mkhize could not be reached for comment over the investigation by the Hawks.National Treasury spokesperson Yolisa Tyantsi declined to comment on the matter affecting Jonas, who blew the whistle on state capture in March this year.Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi denied Mantashe, Mkhize and Jonas were being investigated. He said they (the Hawks) did not know where the claims came from.This after the Sunday Times reported the Hawks were onto Mantashe, Mkhize and Jonas.Meanwhile, SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande said he knows the identity and political motives of the person using the Hawks and NPA in a ploy to nail Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Mantashe.&#x201C;We know who the person is chasing Pravin. We have every detail of his plan. We are going to handle the information very carefully. Keeping quiet does not mean we do not have the information,&#x201D; Nzimande said.He was speaking at the end of the Red October campaign in Sebokeng in the Vaal, Gauteng, yesterday.The agitated Nzimande appealed to ANC, SACP, Cosatu and other alliance partners to close ranks and rally behind Gordhan and Mantashe.&#x201C;The SACP wishes to say today, enough is enough and no more,&quot;We are today drawing a red line and we call upon the people of SA, especially the workers and the poor, to stop this rot and abuse of state organs for purposes of serving narrow accumulation agendas.&#x201C;As the SACP, we are prepared to fight this scourge in the same manner as we fought in defence of Comrade Jacob Zuma some 10 to 13 years ago, when we believed state organs were being used to pursue narrow political agendas,&#x201D; he said.
