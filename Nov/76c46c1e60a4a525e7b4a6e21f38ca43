RESIDENTS of Heinz Park near Philippi say they are living in fear after two people were shot dead and two others landed in hospital after being wounded at a house in Ubushwa Street.Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said the victims were aged 23 and 25, and cases of murder and attempted murder were being investigated.Nyanga Community Policing Forum chairperson Martin Makhasi said the murders could be linked to known feared gangsters in the area.&#x201C;We were doing weekend joint patrols with the community and the police there last week and discovered there were still gangs operating in Heinz Park.&#x201C;It is mind-boggling how a lot of people can be shot after those patrols. It means the area should be patrolled more often. We will talk to the residents again to see if is there anything we can do to end this scourge. We cannot allow the community to be trapped by merciless gangsters,&#x201D; he said.When the Cape Times visited the area yesterday, visibly shaken residents didn&apos;t want to speak, citing fear for their lives. One said: &#x201C;There are always shootings in the area. But we cannot say anything as we might be targeted.&#x201D;No one has been arrested in connection with the incident.In a separate incident, a taxi driver was shot and killed in Nyanga on Sunday. Rwexana said a case of murder was under investigation after the body of a 40-year-old man was found with multiple gunshot wounds at about 8.30pm at Nyanga Terminus.Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association chairperson Victor Wiwi said: &#x201C;We are still trying to establish how and why our driver was killed. There are no tensions within the association and it has been that way for a long time. We urge all our members to come forward with the information that would help the police to arrest those responsible.&#x201D;Anyone with information is requested to contact Crime Stop on 08600&#xA0;1011 or send an anonymous SMS to Crime Line on 32211.
