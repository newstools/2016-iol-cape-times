A CONSTITUTIONAL Court judgment that declares it illegal for police to randomly search people and properties for drugs without a warrant is &#x201C;concerning, disappointing and altering drug policing&#x201D;, said Khayelitsha CPF chairperson Eric Kweleta.Before the judgment was delivered, police officers had the right to search for drugs freely.Now they need to apply for a warrant before searches.Kweleta said the judgment &#x201C;does not sit well with us because it is not assisting in apprehending suspects&#x201D;.&#x201C;It is an administrative nightmare and a serious setback.&#x201D;Police spokesperson Andr&#xE9; Traut said the judgment has not impacted on the execution of operations.Community Safety MEC &#x2028;Dan Plato said if police management had a problem with the judgment, &#x201C;their legal team would have to engage Parliament and challenge it&#x201D;.
