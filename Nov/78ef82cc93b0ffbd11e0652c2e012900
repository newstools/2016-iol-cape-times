A FORMER SA Revenue Service (Sars) employee who called his team leader the K-word has insulted all blacks, the Constitutional Court has found.Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng set aside a ruling yesterday for Jacobus Kruger to be reinstated after he had been fired for making the racist remark.Kruger worked as an anti-smuggling officer for Sars in 2007 when he called his team leader, Abel Mboweni, the K-word.A disciplinary hearing was convened and Kruger received a final written warning valid for six months, and a suspension without pay for 10 days.Kruger was also referred for counselling.Dissatisfied with that sanction, then Sars commissioner Pravin Gordhan altered the sanction to a dismissal.Kruger then referred an unfair dismissal dispute to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), arguing that his dismissal was substantively and procedurally unfair.The CCMA overturned the&#x2028;dismissal and it was ordered that Sars reinstate Kruger.Sars then approached the Labour Court, on the grounds that Kruger&#x2019;s reinstatement was inappropriate, and argued that his conduct was insubordinate, racist, derogatory and abusive.The Labour Court found in favour of Kruger.Aggrieved by that outcome, Sars appealed to the Labour Appeal Court, which also ruled in favour of Kruger.Sars then took the matter to the Constitutional Court, where it admitted that the dismissal was procedurally unfair, but argued that reinstatement should not have been ordered since the employment relationship had become intolerable.When delivering judgment yesterday, Justice Mogoeng said South Africans of all races have the shared responsibility to find ways to end racial hatred and its bad outward manifestations.Sars welcomed the judgment yesterday and its spokesperson, Sandile Memela, said they viewed it as a victory for creating a non-&#x2028;racial society.
