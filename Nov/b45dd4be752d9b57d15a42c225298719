MIDDELBURG: Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson, accused of shoving a black man into a coffin while threatening to kill him in a video clip, abandoned their bail application in the Middelburg Magistrate&#x2019;s Court in Mpumalanga on Wednesday.The two men both stated that they feared for their lives and would therefore not continue with a scheduled bail application.The State had planned to oppose their bail application.In a short video, which has since gone viral on social media, a man called Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa is seen pleading for his life after being placed inside the coffin while one of his tormentors tries to close the lid.One is heard saying: &#x201C;We need to pour petrol, now sit still.&#x201D;Oosthuizen and Jackson allegedly beat up Mlotshwa for walking through a farm.They then took him to another location, where they put him in the coffin and threatened to kill him.The pair face charges of kidnapping and assault with intent to commit grievous bodily harm.After the court proceedings, the EFF and the ANC held separate rallies outside the court to show their support for Mlotshwa.Mlotshwa, clad in an ANC T-shirt, was announced to the crowd as being a member of the ANC by ANC Youth League deputy president Desmond Moela.Magistrate Jongilizwe Dumehleli postponed the case to January 25.
