JOHANNESBURG: Tiger Brands, the makers of the insecticide Doom, yesterday warned a pseudo prophet against spraying the insect killer on his followers.Prophet Lethebo Rabalago from the Mount Zion General Assembly in Limpopo shot to infamy at the weekend after pictures of him spraying his flock with Doom ostensibly to heal them of illnesses went viral on social media.Tiger Brands, in a statement, said it was aware of the recent actions which have been circulating on social media by a person referring to himself as Prophet Lethebo. He is seen in pictures spraying Doom into people s faces as part of faith worship. We find this practice alarming and extremely concerning, and want to make very clear that it is unsafe to spray any Doom or any aerosol into people s faces, said Tiger Brands.Lethabo insists he is acting according to his faith, which could see harmful substances used to cure ailments.But Tiger Brands said: Doom has been formulated to kill specific insects, which are detailed on the cans, and the packaging has very clear warnings which must be adhered to. Tiger Brands said using Doom for purposes other than what it is intended for poses risks and is therefore dangerous.They are in the process of contacting the prophet to ask him to refrain from such practices.The Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities said it could not act against the so-called prophet unless the people he sprayed with the insecticide were willing to lay a complaint.
