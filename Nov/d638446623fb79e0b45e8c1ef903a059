MINERAL Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane on Monday filed for an application for an interdict to block the release of former public protector Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s report on state capture.&#x201C;Minister Zwane has had no option but to now become involved in this matter, as he was not afforded an opportunity to answer allegations levelled against him (contained in a letter he received from the public protector),&#x201D; his office said.The report contains her findings on allegations the politically-connected Gupta family yielded vast influence over executive decisions.&#x201C;The public protector cannot confirm or deny if the report makes any adverse findings against the minister,&#x201D; ministerial official Ayanda Shezi said.&#x201C;It is the minister&#x2019;s submission that the report was hastily prepared without due regard to his constitutional rights.&#x201D;Minister of Co-operative Governance and Tradional Affairs Des Van Rooyen takes a similar stance in documents he filed in court on Monday, in a bid to block the release of the report, saying he would suffer &#x201C;grave harm&#x201D; if the report contained adverse findings.Van Rooyen first went to court to block Madonsela&#x2019;s report a week and a half ago. He said he withdrew his application because Madonsela assured him she had not made any adverse findings against him.DA leader Mmusi Maimane said: &#x201C;These interdicts are nothing more than carefully calculated attempts to delay matters and drag out the inevitable release of the public protector&#x2019;s report.&#x201C;Both ministers are well known to be Gupta proxies and, therefore, their scrambling attempts to try to discredit this report is no doubt due to the fact that they are both implicated in the report.&#x201C;In fact, the late joining by both ministers is a clear indication that their only intention is to delay Wednesday&apos;s proceedings as far as possible.&#x201D;He said the DA&#x2019;s legal team would argue that all the applications be dismissed.
