THE City of Cape Town has launched an inquiry into a crash involving three MyCiti buses which left more than 30 people injured during yesterday&apos;s morning peak.Transport for Cape Town Mayco member Brett Herron said two passengers were treated for spinal and head injuries.The pile-up occurred when the D04 bus from Kapteinsklip in Mitchells Plain allegedly drove into a stationary bus at the Civic Centre station.Due to the impact from behind, the T01 bus that operates between Dunoon, Table View and the city, hit another stationary bus &#x2013; the A01 bus operating on the airport route.&#x201C;I was notified of the &#x2028;accident at around 8.30 this morning and I immediately called for a full-scale investigation into the causes of the incident.&quot;I can confirm that the bus driver who allegedly caused the pile-up at the Civic Centre station has been suspended, pending the accident investigation and a disciplinary inquiry,&#x201D; said Herron.He said the passengers on one of the buses had already disembarked at the time of the incident. The A01 bus had a few passengers on board.&#x201C;The safety of our passengers is non-negotiable. As such we will use the findings of the VOC&#x2019;s investigation, as well as the outcome of the investigation conducted by the SAPS, to take further action against the VOC if warranted.&quot;We will use the outcome of these investigations to determine how such incidents can be prevented in future,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;I sincerely wish all of those who were injured a speedy recovery. I once &#x2028;again want to assure the MyCiTi commuters that we will hold those responsible accountable.&#x201D;
