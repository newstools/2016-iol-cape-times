SUPPORTERS of suspended ANC provincial chairperson Marius Fransman protested at the Cape Town Magistrate s Court yesterday to demand that the party s provincial secretary, Faiez Jacobs, step aside .Jacobs, who appeared in court yesterday for assault, was found guilty in an ANC disciplinary process and handed a suspended sentence.A WhatsApp message was distributed among supporters of Fransman early yesterday, asking that they go to the Cape Town Magistrate s Court to protest against Jacobs over his alleged assault of former ANC researcher Wesley Seale.When protesters eventually got to court to confront Jacobs, he had made his appearance and his case was postponed for further investigation to February 24 next year. The small group of protesters comprised members from the SA National Civic Organisation and the Congress of South African Students (Cosas).Two weeks ago, the ANC s national disciplinary committee announced that it had imposed a five-year suspension of Fransman s party membership for abusing his office to obtain sexual favours, and bringing the party into disrepute.Fransman has indicated that he would appeal the findings. Organiser of the court protest and unofficial Fransman spokesperson Vanessa le Roux said: If we speak about morality, it should not just apply to one (Fransman), it should apply to all. Faiez Jacobs was in court today and Khaya (Magaxa acting ANC provincial chairperson) not once spoke about it at his press conference. Jacobs said the ANC had already responded to his case, and that there could be no similarities drawn between his case and that of Fransman. The issues are very different, I have been found guilty by an internal process of the ANC. I accept the sanction. The case is unfolding in court; we ll just have to wait for it. Whatever comes out in court, the ANC can then apply its mind to the matter (on whether I should be removed), said Jacobs.[email&#160;protected]
