THE knives are out for National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams after analysts and political parties called for his head.Constitutional law expert Professor Pierre de Vos of UCT and head of politics at Stellenbosch University Professor Amanda Gouws, on Monday said advocate Abrahams could be charged with misconduct and face an inquiry into his fitness to hold office.This comes as the EFF and ANC heavyweight Mathews Phosa said they had written to the General Council of the Bar to investigate Abrahams and called for him to be struck off the roll of advocates.This approach to the Bar Council comes as his deputies, Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi, face an inquiry into their fitness to hold office.On Monday, Jiba&#x2019;s lawyers wrote to President Jacob Zuma to give reasons why Jiba should not be suspended pending an inquiry.Jiba and Mrwebi were struck off the roll of advocates by the high court in September after a complaint by the General Council of the Bar.It appears Abrahams may follow in the footsteps of his suspended deputies.The EFF and DA also confirmed yesterday that the march in Pretoria would go ahead tomorrow despite the dropping of the charges against Gordhan.Gordhan&#x2019;s lawyer Tebogo Malatji declined to comment. It is not yet clear if Gordhan will sue for malicious prosecution, but analysts believe Abrahams may have a case to answer on what happened.De Vos said things did not look good for Abrahams and the NPA.&#x201C;There are two options here, either the NPA is catastrophically incompetent or it was motivated by ulterior motives in the case,&#x201D; he said.He said it was strange and surprising why the NPA prosecuted Gordhan when there was no case to answer.&#x201C;There will be questions on the misconduct of members of the NPA or the head of the NPA,&#x201D; he said.De Vos added that the General Council of the Bar, Parliament or Zuma may investigate Abrahams and remove him from office.Gouws said Abrahams did not do his homework before charging Gordhan.&#x201C;There should be an inquiry because it&#x2019;s not clear he took the decision on his own.&#x201C;I also think that meeting at Luthuli House was improper,&#x201D; she said.The EFF has also questioned the meeting between Zuma, Abrahams and other ANC ministers at Luthuli House.Zuma told the National Council of Provinces last week the meeting at Luthuli House was discussing something else and not charges against Gordhan. This was after it emerged the meeting at the ANC Headquarters in Johannesburg took place a day before Gordhan was charged by the NPA.The Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law said yesterday they would withdraw their application in the high court for a permanent stay of prosecution against Gordhan.The groundswell of support for Gordhan stretched across political parties to civil society and the banking community.The Banking Association of South Africa (Basa) said it welcomed the decision to drop the charges against Gordhan, but warned of the damage already done to the country.&#x201C;We are obviously relieved the NPA has made, belatedly, the correct decision, but the damage has already been done. The economic impact immediately following the decision to lay charges was very negative and, again, sent out a message that there are attempts at political influence on our critical institutions,&#x201D; Basa said.
