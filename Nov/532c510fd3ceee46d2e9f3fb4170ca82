PROMINENT city attorney Noorudien Hassan&#x2019;s family is struggling to come to terms with his cold-blooded murder.Gunmen shot him several times in front of his Lansdowne home on Monday night.The 45-year-old was on the passenger side of his friend&#x2019;s car, preparing to enter his house, when the gunmen approached and killed him.Police say the murder is being investigated and a motive is yet to be established.Hassan had been defence attorney in a number of high-profile court cases, including matters involving Irshaad Laher and alleged 28s gang boss Ralph Stanfield, both accused in matters involving illegal guns.Laher has been linked to the sale of firearms stolen by police Colonel Christiaan Prinsloo, who admitted in court he had sold the weapons to gangs in Cape Town.Stanfield is on trial for running an illegal gun licensing syndicate.Hassan also represented Sotheby&#x2019;s International Realty SA chief executive Jason Rohde, who stands accused of murdering his wife.Hassan&#x2019;s sister Haseema said the family were still in a state of shock and disbelief.There was a previous attack on Hassan&#x2019;s life when, in 2014, an explosive device was hurled at his home, causing damage to the front porch, the roof and windows.&#x201C;This is unreal and our mother is finding it very difficult as he was at her house last night (Monday). We are being counselled, especially his two young children, to deal with this tragedy,&#x201D; Haseema said.At Hassan&#x2019;s funeral yesterday, advocate Pete Mihalik, who had known Hassan for nearly two decades, said Hassan never discriminated against anyone who needed legal representation.Hassan leaves behind his wife and two young children.Cape Law Society director Frank Dorey said: &#x201C;We are deeply shocked and saddened by the untimely passing of Mr Hassan and particularly by the violent circumstances in which he lost his life.&quot;We extend our sincere condolences to Mr Hassan&#x2019;s family, friends and colleagues during this difficult time.&#x201D;No one has been arrested and anyone with information can contact Lansdowne detectives on 021&#xA0;700&#xA0;9000, or 082&#xA0;576&#xA0;2804 or Crime Stop on 08600&#xA0;10111.
