DA COUNCILLORS who defied the party&#x2019;s Cape Town metro hierarchy in electing Ward 7 (Kraaifontein/Scottsdene) councillor Grant Twigg to chair subcouncil 2 now face possible suspension.Twigg had formerly been the DA&#x2019;s caucus chairperson in the City, but was demoted by mayor Patricia de Lille in favour of Shaun August, who also became the party&#x2019;s leader in the metro when his predecessor, Grant Pascoe, defected to the ANC in 2014.Chairing a subcouncil comes with a salary package of just under R1&#xA0;million a year.It is believed that De Lille had preferred former subcouncil 6 chairperson Clive Justus. But at Tuesday&#x2019;s meeting to vote for a chairperson, the DA councillors &#x2013; Marian Nieuwoudt, Carin Brynard, Siseko Mbandezi, Xoliswa Pakela-Maphasa and Cynthia Classen &#x2013; voted overwhelmingly for Twigg, who also cast a vote for himself. Justus abstained from the vote on realising that he did not have the support of his colleagues.Yesterday, August confirmed that the DA&#x2019;s metro executive had met to discuss the issue, and that he had called subcouncil manager Fred Monk to have the election of Twigg scrapped, and for the meeting of the subcouncil to be reconvened so that another vote could take place.&#x201C;We are proposing to put them (DA members) under suspension for an investigation,&#x201D; said August.The party is expected to make an announcement today on the matter.Twigg confirmed that he had received a letter from August, but would not state its content, instead saying it was &#x201C;internal DA matters&#x201D;.&#x201C;It&#x2019;s about my election as subcouncil chair,&#x201D; was all Twigg was prepared to say.But the ANC was quick to jump into the fray, using the opportunity to lash the DA for its own factionalism.
