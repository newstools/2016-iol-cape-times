YOUNG musical prodigy Qden Blaauw has returned from Poland inspired after studying at the feet of one of the world&apos;s most revered concert pianists.Blaauw, 12, a Grade 6 pupil from Welgemoed Primary, has raked in the awards after only taking up piano and violin three years ago.In his first year of competing he has won the 2016 Samro Hubert van der Spuy National Music Competition, seven trophies at the 2016 Stellenbosch Eisteddfod and two trophies at the 2016 Cape Town Eisteddfod.He applied and was accepted into the Allianz Junior Music Camp in Poland, where he was one of 10 children selected from about 500 applications.The camp included a master class from Chinese concert pianist Lang Lang, who has performed with leading orchestras from around the world.Qden&#x2019;s proud father, Denric Blaauw, said it was extraordinary that his son had achieved so much in such a short period of time.&#x201C;To be selected for this music camp is astounding, but when you consider he&apos;s the first South African selected it brings it into perspective.&quot;There was skills development and fun, but for me it was seeing the connections and bonds my son made with these other exceptional kids,&#x201D; said Blaauw.He said his son had to perform a concert piece and submit a video on why he wanted to be part of the camp.&#x201C;They were given instruction by two professors from Munich University the first few days, and then by Lang Lang. No child older than 14 is allowed to enter and there was a 9-year-old who started playing at age six, which just shows us how exceptional our child is to have been selected,&#x201D; said Blaauw.He said he was never as proud or as overwhelmed as when his son performed before a massive audience at the final concert.Qden&#x2019;s mother Quinette Blaauw said her son inspires them and his younger sister Quine with his passion and drive.&#x201C;It dawned on me when he performed live at the concert how unbelievable this has all been. While the other children come from music academies, Qden received lessons at the Hugo Lambrechts Music Centre,&#x201D; said Quinette.She said she appreciates Qden&#x2019;s drive and his passion to keep going.Qden said the entire experience had been unforgettable and he will hold on to the friendships he has made.&#x201C;It was a lot of hard work, but also fun going through the camp. I was also exposed to new things and my music given a bigger audience,&#x201D; said Qden.He said he would continue to compose his own music and work toward having the world&#x2019;s orchestras play his work, conducted by him.&#x201C;That is my dream and that is what I will work towards as I develop as a pianist and conductor. I also want to compete internationally and I hope to see the new friends I made in the process,&#x201D; said Qden. [email&#160;protected]
