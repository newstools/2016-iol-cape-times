Pretoria - President Jacob Zuma has withdrawn his court application to keep the state capture report under wraps.My instructions are to withdraw the application, Zuma&#x2019;s advocate said in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, on Tuesday morning.The court has not yet officially noted the withdrawal, but it is clear that Zuma is not going ahead.His advocate Anthea Platt said the president tendered to pay the legal costs for the entire application, which will include all the other parties&apos; costs.Zuma was represented by a state attorney - thus the taxpayer will have to pay legal costs.Opposition parties afre now asking that Zuma pay himself, as it said that he did not bring the application in the public interest, but in his personal capacity.They also want a punitive cost order against him.Arguments regarding costs are still proceeding.
