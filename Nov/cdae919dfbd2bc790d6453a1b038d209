President Jacob Zuma continued to face mounting pressure over the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) Bill after civil society and parties lobbied him to sign it into law.But the black business sector has asked Zuma to reject the bill as it has some unconstitutional issues.But Zuma may find himself in court first before he decides whether to sign the Fica Bill into law.Zuma admitted in Parliament yesterday, through a written reply, that he was still applying his mind to the bill.The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) on Friday lodged an application in the Constitutional Court for Zuma to either sign the bill into law or refer it back to Parliament. Casac has given Zuma 30 days to sign the bill into law.In his written reply to a question from DA MP David Maynier, Zuma said he had received petitions on the Fica Bill. &#x201C;Yes, I have received formal objections to the signing of the bill from the Progressive Professionals and the Black Business Council.&#x201C;When I am petitioned not to sign a bill, I have an obligation to consider the merits of such objection,&#x201D; he said.EFF deputy leader Floyd Shivambu and Casac executive secretary Lawson Naidoo had written to him and urged him to sign the bill into law.In the court papers, Naidoo said Zuma had failed in his constitutional duties to assent to the bill, which he has been sitting on since June.Naidoo said the bill was intended to clamp down on money laundering and financing terrorism. &#x201C;It will also bring the country in line with international standards.&#x201D;
