A NEW board game has been created to help empower and encourage young people to reach for the sky.Designed by Dutch-based Luden&#x2019;s Lab together with Semanori, a Cape Town-based company that works with NGOs on socio-economic development, the Sky is The Limit board game was designed to help young offenders and at-risk youths develop new skills.It&apos;s also aimed at being a useful tool to help them critically analyse their current conditions and find positive approaches to improving their environment.The response so far has been positive, said Semanori executive director Jacques Sibomana.&#x201C;In the past few weeks we have conducted several workshops with different NGOs in Cape Town, including (but not limited to) Nicro, Ikamva Youth and Young in Prison.&quot;The response has been phenomenal, with the game being welcomed as a much-needed tool that will surely add value to many South African youths as well as add value to existing life orientation programmes,&#x201D; said Sibomana.He said from their workshops with Young in Prison members there was a collective agreement that the game would add much-needed value and provide a different approach to individual and community problems.&#x201C;We&apos;re very proud of the introduction of the Sky is The Limit game; we believe that this game will truly have a positive impact on many South African youths.&quot;The practicality of the game and its easy implementation in real-life scenarios makes it a very important tool towards development,&#x201D; said Sibomana.Venessa Padayachee, who is Nicro&#x2019;s Advocacy and Lobbying manager, believes the game will help young people be more future-oriented and start them thinking about their dreams again.&#x201C;Usually, kids in gang-ridden and violent communities are just surviving and only think of surviving today.&quot;This game will give them hope for the future, and engage them in a more positive line of thinking,&#x201D; said Padayachee.Social worker Arina Smit said the game was not only fun, but also fundamental.&#x201C;If used correctly, it can help participants to safely explore different social situations and practice how to successfully navigate these choppy waters, without even realising the extent of the work they are putting in,&#x201D; said Smit.The developers say while the recent feedback has been positive the true benefits of the game will only be truly significant once it&apos;s made available to the youth.
