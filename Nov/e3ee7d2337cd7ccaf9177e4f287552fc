BREAD tags are made of high-impact polystyrene and can be recycled into seedling trays, cornices, skirtings, outdoor furniture, coat hangers, poles and decking.They can also be collected to &#x201C;purchase&#x201D; wheelchairs for people with mobility impairments, who are financially unable to afford one.Each year, South Africa celebrates National Disability Rights Awareness Month between November 3 and December 3, and as part of this year&#x2019;s campaign, the Polystyrene Packaging Council (PSPC) is once again encouraging people to collect bread tags and donate them.The council was formed in 2007 to demonstrate the polystyrene industry&#x2019;s commitment to the environment through collection and recycling, and the safety and health of polystyrene food packaging.Currently in its ninth year, the PSPC&#x2019;s hugely successful Breadtags for Wheelchairs project has already touched hundreds of lives around South Africa and also recently expanded internationally to Japan and Australia.According to PSPC director Adri Spangenberg, they have close to 1&#x2005;000 co-ordinators around the country, who assist with the bread tags collection.&#x201C;The network of volunteers is made up of teachers, learners, churches and individuals, who all diligently collect bread tags in order to make a big difference in the lives of the less fortunate.&#x201D;Close to 300 wheelchairs are handed over each year.&#x201C;We have established a network of buyers around the country who have agreed to pay R8 for each kilogram of bread tags that are collected.&#x201C;Once enough tags have been collected to cover the cost of the wheelchair selected, this money is then paid over to the pharmacy or wheelchair supplier of their choice.&#x201D;Because it&apos;s important to ensure that the correct wheelchair is purchased for quadriplegics, the QuadPara Association of South Africa (QASA) assists with assessing the requirements of the recipient.Similarly, specialist wheelchair supplier CE Mobility services the wheelchairs to ensure they stay in a good condition.They also committed themselves to donate one wheelchair to a needy recipient for every wheelchair bought through them using the bread tags.&#x201C;Apart from the knowledge that we are addressing a big need in our communities, we also don&apos;t want to see these bread tags end up in our country&apos;s landfills as they have a good recycling market value.&#x201C;Factories manufacturing polystyrene and other plastics consume less energy and natural resources when they used recycled products, resulting in a cleaner, greener and healthier environment.&#x201C;It is important for us to raise awareness that polystyrene is successfully being recycled in South Africa and to create new markets for this recycled product, while at the same time changing somebody&apos;s life with one small act of kindness.&#x201D; For more information about how to get involved in the Breadtags for Wheelchair project, visitwww.polystyrenepackaging.co.za or visit their Facebook page on www.facebook.com/#!/groups/btagsforwchairs
