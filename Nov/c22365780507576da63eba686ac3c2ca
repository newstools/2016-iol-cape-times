A FLAMINGO trapped in debris along the Liesbeeck River had a lucky escape after it was spotted by a motorist driving along the M5 &#x2028;highway.Lansdowne resident Ruth, who would not give her last name, said she was driving along the highway when she stopped to show her Brazilian friend the flamingos.&#x201C;We noticed that one of the flamingos was trying to move but couldn&apos;t, there was something attached to its leg.&#x201D;She called the City of Cape Town and the SPCA, who arrived minutes later.&#x201C;The SPCA used a net and managed to get the trapped bird out of trouble.&quot;There was also a piece of string attached to its neck,&#x201D; she added.SPCA spokesperson Tara McGovern said fortunately the bird was not injured and managed to fly away on its own.&#x201C;Two months ago we had (a) &#x2028;flamingo in a similar situation at Zeekoevlei, but that one died of its injuries after two days,&#x201D; added McGovern.Mayco member for Utility Services Alderman Ernest Sonnenberg said the cleaning of rivers and canals was undertaken twice a year, once during summer and before the winter period.&#x201C;Specific attention is also given to sections of rivers and canals where high sediment load enters the system and/or high levels of illegally dumped refuse and litter is prevalent,&#x201D; said Sonnenberg.He said additional cleaning was undertaken on an ad-hoc basis along river and canal systems passing through or adjacent to informal areas.&#x201C;In fact, in areas where there are high levels of pollution, or dumping we conduct daily cleaning.&quot;With regard to the maintenance of stormwater and river systems, there has been significant pressure over the past years to clear rivers and canals of illegally dumped refuse and litter to maintain the hydraulic functioning of the systems,&#x201D; added Sonnenberg.He added that the City&#x2019;s wastewater management department &#x2028;issued fines for illegal dumping between June and October this &#x2028;year.
