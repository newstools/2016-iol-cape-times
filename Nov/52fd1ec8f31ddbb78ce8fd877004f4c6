The City of Cape Town has launched a full-scale investigation into the incident in which three of its MyCiti buses were involved in a accident in the CBD on Tuesday morning which left dozens of people shocked or injured.Transport for Cape Town (TCT), the city&#x2019;s transport authority, said the incident happened at the Civic Centre station in Hertzog Boulevard at approximately 8:20am.&#x201C;Following the accident, 37 passengers and one bus driver were taken to the Christiaan Barnard Memorial Hospital and Somerset Hospital for medical check-ups,&#x201D; the TCT SAID. &#x201C;Two passengers are being treated for spinal and head injuries. Preliminary indications are that the other passengers sustained minor injuries and are suffering from shock.&#x201D;The City&#x2019;s Mayoral Committee Member for Transport, Brett Herron, said: &#x201C;I was notified of the accident at around 08:30 this morning and I immediately called for a full-scale investigation into the causes of the incident. I can confirm that the bus driver who allegedly caused the pile-up at the Civic Centre station has been suspended, pending the accident investigation and a disciplinary inquiry.&#x201C;In addition, the City will ensure that the vehicle operating company (VOC) that operates the D04 route between Mitchells Plain West and the Civic Centre compiles a comprehensive accident report. This report must be submitted to myself and the Commissioner of Transport for Cape Town before the close of business on Friday 11 November 2016.&#x201C;The safety of our passengers is non-negotiable. As such, we will use the findings of the VOC&#x2019;s investigation, as well as the outcome of the investigation conducted by the South African Police Service (SAPS), to take further action against the VOC if warranted. We will use the outcome of these investigations to determine how such incidents can be prevented in future.&#x201D;The pile-up happened at about 8:20 when the D04 bus from Kapteinsklip in Mitchells Plain apparently drove into a stationary bus at the Civic Centre station. Due to the impact from behind, the T01 bus that operates between Dunoon, Table View, and the city, hit another stationary bus &#x2013; the A01 bus operating on the airport route.&#x201C;The passengers on the T01 bus had already disembarked at the time of the incident and the A01 bus had a few passengers on board. The D04 bus was full, given that it happened in the peak period,&#x201D; Herron said.&#x201C;I sincerely wish all of those who were injured a speedy recovery. I once again want to assure the MyCiTi commuters that we will hold those responsible accountable.&#x201D;MyCiTi buses operating to and from the Civic Centre station were delayed for about an hour as a result of the collisions, while traffic along Hertzog Boulevard was also severely affected.&#x2013; African News Agency (ANA)
