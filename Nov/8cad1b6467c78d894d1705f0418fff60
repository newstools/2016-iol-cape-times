The ANC called on its members on Thursday not to be used by people who sought to advance their own private interests.Commenting on Thuli Madonsela&apos;s state capture report, the ruling party said it provided an opportunity for the ANC to discuss the allegations and &#x201C;deal with its &#x2028;outcomes&#x201D;.&#x201C;As the ANC and the country engages with the recommendations of the public &#x2028;protector&#x2019;s report, the ANC calls on all its members to remain uncompromisingly intolerant of corruption.&#x201D;It stood by an earlier decision of its national executive committee to introduce lifestyle audits for its leaders.Eskom boss Brian Molefe on Thursday reiterated his denial of being &#x201C;captured&#x201D; by the Guptas after the report revealed cellphone tracking records suggesting he had dealings with the controversial family on numerous occasions.These showed Molefe was at or near the Guptas&#x2019; Saxonwold compound in Johannesburg 19 times between August 5 and November 17 last year.The report, which investigated the alleged influence and improper relationship of the Gupta family in the removal and appointment of ministers and directors of state-owned entities, further said Molefe and Ajay Gupta made 58 telephone calls to one another between August 2015 and March 2016.Molefe did not deny being in the vicinity of the Guptas during those dates, but did not admit being in the Gupta compound or meeting the Gupta brothers either.&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a shebeen there, two streets away from the Guptas. I will not admit or deny that I have gone to the shebeen, but there is a shebeen there,&#x201D; Molefe said.
