A NEW CROSSROADS family has more questions than answers after their 10-year-old son, whose identity the Cape Times is withholding, was found hanging from a washing line in their yard.Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said a death inquest case has been opened.His lifeless body was discovered as his aunt prepared to hang up washing on Friday.His uncle said it was &#x201C;strange&#x201D; the way he was hanging, for it did not look like a suicide.He said the rope the child had used was tied so tight it had to be cut from his neck with a knife.&#x201C;You would expect the feet of someone who hung himself to be hovering, but his feet were firmly on the ground. He did not mess himself.&#x201D;He said yesterday the incident had not sunk in yet.The boy&#x2019;s traumatised mother was the worst affected, crying non-stop.He said the family was puzzled as the child had not reported bullying or intimidation.&#x201C;We are asking ourselves questions that we have no answers to. This child did not show any suicidal signs. Only God knows what happened.&#x201D;Provincial Social Development Department spokesperson Sihle Ngobese said: &#x201C;Child suicide is a very serious issue. We understand this is very traumatic for the family.&#x201C;Imagine looking at that lifeless little body. We will send highly qualified counsellors, social workers and &#x2028;therapists.&#x201D;
