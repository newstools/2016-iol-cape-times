Fears of a renewed gang war between rival gangs in Bishop Lavis are mounting.This after more than 250 illegal firearms and ammunition were recovered with an undisclosed amount of cash at a house in Valhalla Park.The Bishop Lavis Community Policing Forum (CPF) on Monday saida group of people, including alleged gang members, marched to the police station to demand the release of four arrested in connection with possession of illegal firearms. Police fired stun grenades and teargas to disperse the crowd before they reached the police station, he said.Bishop Lavis CPF chairperson Graham Lindhorst said while the discovery dealt a huge blow to gangs in the area, the end result would be a war as gangs were likely to go to other areas to look for firearms.&#x201C;Our view is that this is indeed a good and magnificent find. The only problem is that they will start looking for other ways to get guns. We understand they are threatening to rob police officers of their firearms.&quot;This will also lead to gang fights because they don&apos;t have the power they had. It&apos;s all about territory.&#x201D;Police said they were confident last Friday&#x2019;s breakthrough would assist in clamping down on the scourge of gangsterism and in &#x201C;reducing the stubborn contact crime trends&#x201D; affecting communities.But yesterday charges against two of the five accused, Clive van Schalkwyk and Shahid Mohamed, were withdrawn when they appeared in the Goodwood Magistrate&#x2019;s Court.The National Prosecuting Authority said it was forging ahead with its case against Johannes Abrahams sr, his son Johannes Abrahams in, and his sister Bonita Abrahams.NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: &#x201C;The charges were withdrawn against the two because of lack of evidence.&#x201D;Lindhorst said the house in Valhalla Park allegedly belonged to a drug dealer. He said one of the two men released on Monday was in the &#x201C;wrong place at the wrong time&#x201D;.&#x201C;His wife had contacted us to find out how we could assist. We were aware that they would be released.&#x201C;He owns a barber shop, but just happened to be there at the time.&#x201D;They were remanded in custody to enable the State to probe their backgrounds, essentially whether they have any previous convictions, pending criminal cases or outstanding warrants. They will appear in court on Thursday.
