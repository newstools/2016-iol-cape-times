Parliament President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday, said there would be no fee-free education until government came up with solutions on how to fund it. We are not going to do so, it s not an easy situation. What it means, government in particular would have to budget for that and pay for it, Zuma said speaking during his last quarterly question-and-answer session in the National Assembly. It was not going to be simple to say since the students that are making this call, the government said its fine when it has not established the feasibility. The President asked opposition MPs who were critical of government s response to the student crisis, which saw thousands of students from universities go on the rampage and disrupt the academic programme demanding that #FeesMustFall, to be patient and wait for the final report of the commission he set up in January to probe the feasibility of fee-free education. There is not one view on the matter that you can just have free education just like that. There are other processes that are taking place, which once the commission has concluded its work will have to look at. The commission is due to hand over its final report to the President on June 30 next year.African News Agency
