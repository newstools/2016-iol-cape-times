INTERVIEWS for the new inspector-general of intelligence continued yesterday as members of the joint standing committee grilled one candidate, to such an extent he was almost brought to tears.Andile Kilifele said he studied at UCT and Wits, where he obtained his LLB before he started working, but the ANC&#x2019;s Dumisani Gamede wanted him to account for a gap in his CV between November 2003 and April 2004, and his frequent &#x201C;job-hopping&#x201D;.&#x201C;The longest you have served was in your last job, where you worked from 2008 to 2014, but with the rest it was hardly a year?&#x201D; asked Gamede.Kilifele, 42, said he studied at UCT from 1996 to 1999.&#x201C;Before that I was a kitchen boy at 18 Keerom Street &#x2013; it used to be a hotel. I worked there for a month or two, I then went to UCT.&#x201D;He came close to tears when he described his financial situation.&#x201C;Where I come from things were not going well financially. I had to work because my mom couldn&#x2019;t afford to enrol me at UCT&#x2026; My mom was a housekeeper and my father was a janitor.&#x201D;Ten candidates have been shortlisted for the position, to provide oversight for &#x2028;intelligence and security services, left vacant when&#x2028;former inspector-general of intelligence Faith Radebe&#x2019;s term ended in April 2015.Yesterday, Clinton Davids, Dr Nhlakanipho Nkontwana, Victor Ngidi, Isaac Dintwe and Nyelisani Tshitereke were interviewed for the vacant post, along with Kilifele, who was among those shortlisted for the post when it became available last year.The initial interviews had to be abandoned last year when MPs could not agree on a new inspector-general despite the ANC pushing for its former MP Cecil Burgess to get the job.A two-thirds majority is required for confirmation, which the ANC lacked and Burgess&#x2019;s role in bulldozing the &quot;Secrecy Bill&#x201D; through the National Assembly scuppered his hopes among opposition parties.When asked about his financial status, Kilifele admitted he had a default judgment against him for debt, since paid off, he owed on a store credit card after his wife was retrenched from her job.Kilifele quit his job as a divisional head within the National Intelligence Agency to seek pupillage with a law firm and return to legal practice, but was now a stay-at-home dad after his application was rejected. He now involved himself in community work and volunteering at his children&#x2019;s school governing body as its secretary.Asked about any outstanding civil judgments by committee chairperson Charles Nqakula (ANC) and why Kilifele answered &#x201C;No&#x201D; on his application, he said the application form did not ask about any judgments against him.The DA&#x2019;s Herman Groenewald asked Kilifele about his management style should he become the inspector-general.Kilifele said should he be appointed, he would like to &#x201C;contribute and foster the respect for the rule of law&quot;.
