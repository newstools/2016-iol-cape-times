THE DA has defended Wilma Brady, its candidate for today&apos;s by-election in Ward 108 (Mfuleni/Blue Downs), who is implicated in the illegal sale of provincial government-owned land to a housing developer.The case against Brady stems from a letter she signed in 2006 authorising Lelethu Properties and Development to build 33 houses on provincial land in Delft. A disciplinary committee found Brady guilty of contravening the Code of Conduct for councillors and recommended a fine of R5&#x2005;000.ANC councillor Charlotte Heyns said yesterday the DA could not complain about corruption in national government when it had failed to deal with those in its midst who are accused of fraud.&#x201C;They are not serious at all about fighting corruption,&#x201D; said Heyns.After Lelethu Properties and Development had built the homes on the disputed land, the provincial government took possession of the land and those whose houses had been built there lost their homes.The contractor then filed a criminal complaint of fraud against Brady. The case is due in the Bellville Commercial Crimes Court in February.Heyns said the DA was &#x201C;scared&#x201D; to kick out Brady because despite the scandal she remained a popular figure among the party&apos;s coloured supporters in the Blue Downs area, where she had previously been a ward councillor.Brady could not be reached for comment yesterday.Shaun August, the DA&#x2019;s chairperson in the Cape Town metro and its chief whip in the City of Cape Town, said Brady was an experienced councillor and had done outstanding work in her constituency.While she had lost the ward when she last stood as a candidate on August 3, August said anything was possible in politics and an ANC majority this time around was not guaranteed.He refused to be drawn into Brady&#x2019;s outstanding legal matter, saying he would leave it up to the courts to pronounce whether she was guilty or innocent.This was echoed by the DA&#x2019;s provincial spokesperson, Anneke Scheepers, who said: &#x201C;Should a guilty verdict arise, however, the party will take action&#x2028;accordingly.&#x201D; [email&#160;protected] @mtyala
