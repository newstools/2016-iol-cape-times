&#x2018;WOULD love it if someone would please explain to me how you think selling a dress for 7 to 8 year olds with the slogan &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t sit with us&apos; is OK.&quot;This was the question an aggrieved parent posed to Jet Stores on its Facebook page. The mother, Clarissa Lester Witten, pointed out the T-shirt promoted bulling in a society that was tirelessly working to eradicate such misbehaviour.&#x201C;You are undermining the efforts of all those promoting kindness and inclusion.&#x2028;I will cut up my store card and swiftly move along to a store with more ethics than yours,&#x201D; wrote Witten on the Jet Facebook page.&#x201C;Children are committing suicide after being bullied or made to feel less, then you sell clothing that promotes segregation,&#x201D; she said.Another Facebook user, Nadja Bester, commented: &quot;I am thoroughly shocked at how this made it through your approval processes without anyone raising an eyebrow.&#x201D;Bester went on to suggest an anti-bullying campaign should follow from the incident.Responding to the Facebook complaint, Jet&#x2019;s online team immediately apologised and thanked Witten for raising her dissatisfaction, and said the T-shirts would be taken off its shelves.&#x201C;Good day Clarissa, thank you so much for engaging with us. We&#x2019;d like to let you know that your complaint has been heard and will be taken seriously.&#x201C;These T-shirts are in the process of being taken off our shelves. Please remain patient with us as we attempt to resolve this. Many thanks, Jet online team,&#x201D; read the Facebook response.In a formal statement, Jet Stores said: &#x201C;As a company, Jet is against bullying in any form and it is something we absolutely do not condone.&#x201C;We would first and foremost like to apologise. We have taken immediate measures to recall the T-shirt in question from all our stores, and we are looking to create a T-shirt with the slogan, &#x2018;You can SO sit with us&#x2019;.&quot;We are sorry if we may have encouraged behaviour we as a company do not stand for, but we are also grateful for our customer engagement.&#x201D;
