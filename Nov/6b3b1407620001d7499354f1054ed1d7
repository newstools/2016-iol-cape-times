THE performance of the government departments and entities has improved after Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu found an increase of 24 percent in departments and state entities with clean audits in the past three years. Makwetu said while this was a marginal improvement, it was significant because it showed there was progress. According to him, between 2013 and this year, the number of departments and entities with clean audits increased from 122 to 152.The improvement was commended as it showed financial discipline, Makwetu added, warning he was concerned about the poor performance of three key departments.He said the departments of Education, Health and Public Works, which get 37 percent of the state's total budget, either received disclaimers or qualified audit opinions.Makwetu said there were improvements in the Eastern Cape, Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. But if you look at the highest number of auditees who have clean audits, it's the Western Cape, followed by Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. The Western Cape led the pack with 79 percent of clean audits, followed by Gauteng with 60 percent, and KZN with 35 percent. The provinces with the poorest outcomes, based on the number of auditees with disclaimed and adverse opinions or outstanding audits, were North West (22 percent) and the Free State (11 percent), said Makwetu report.He said provinces such as Limpopo lacked implementation measures and financial discipline, adding it was concerning that Mpumalanga and the Free State had regressed.Makwetu said there had been a significant increase in irregular expenditure of 80 percent from the previous financial year to R46.36 billion. He said the biggest contributor to this was the Passenger Rail Agency of SA, with an irregular expenditure of R14bn.Another entity had an irregular expenditure of R2.4bn.
