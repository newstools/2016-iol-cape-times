Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela has no right to order the President to institute a commission of inquiry into state capture, Jacob Zuma said in the National Assembly on Wednesday.Replying to questions from MPs, the President did not have kind words for Madonsela or her State of Capture report which directs Zuma to appoint a judicial inquiry, headed by a judge to be named by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, within 30 days to use her report as a starting point to probe in depth all allegations of abuse of the state to benefit the Gupta business empire. This report has been dealt with in a very funny way. It affected me and many, no fairness at all, Zuma said. Even the manner in which the recommendations is made, it is the president who has the right to appoint a commission. No one, no matter what positions they hold, can instruct a president to appoint a commission. Madonsela said the inquiry has to be completed within six months, while flagging instances where Zuma may have flouted the law and calling on the National Prosecuting Authority and the police to probe possible cause for criminal charges contained in the report.
