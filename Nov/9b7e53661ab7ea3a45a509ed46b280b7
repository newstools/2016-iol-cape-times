UCT's newly-appointed deputy vice-chancellor of Transformation, professor Loretta Feris, believes now is the opportune time to facilitate change and rebuild trust between the university and its students. Vice-chancellor Dr Max Price announced the appointment, which will take effect from January.The married mother of one is a professor of law in the Institute of Marine and Environmental Law and teaches natural resources law, pollution law and international environmental law.Her extensive r&eacute;sum&eacute; also includes her time at the Washington College of Law at American University in Washington DC, first as international legal studies fellow and later as assistant director of the International Legal Studies Program, assistant co-ordinator of the Humphrey Fellowship Program and Adjunct Professor of Law.Having served on many committees and bodies at UCT she also served as vice-chair of the Black Academic Caucus earlier this year. The hard work starts now and I have always believed to constantly engage students. &quot;We need to acknowledge this space is not inclusive and address issues be it race, gender, masculinity or rape culture, said Feris.As a black female academic having lived the experience of the institution she had the internal debate of staying or leaving, said Feris. The protest created an opportunity for discussions, formal and informal, to look at certain issues like decolonising curriculum. &quot;Right now academics are researching that very prospects and since last year renaming of buildings and spaces. She said it must be asked why even if the institution attracts them, why are black academics not retained or many produced. I see my role as a facilitator, including the creation of committees like the Shackville TRC and of who it consists of. &quot;There needs to be ownership and agency as we work towards reshaping the institution. Feris says she is passionate about the challenge that awaits her. dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
