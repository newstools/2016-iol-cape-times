THE province&#x2019;s top teachers were honoured in 10 different categories at the weekend.This year&#x2019;s theme, &quot;Our teachers, our Olympians&quot;, acknowledged the extraordinary efforts of teachers who excel, often under difficult&#x2028;circumstances.In its 17th year, the awards are presented annually at &#x2028;provincial and national level.The rigorous adjudication process culminates in a &#x2028;prestigious awards ceremony, where the provincial winners are announced by the MEC.Ten teachers from 41 nominations in the province were honoured on Friday.The winners comprise primary school teachers, secondary school teachers, excellency in Grade R teaching, excellency in special needs and inclusive teaching, excellency in teaching physical science, excellency in teaching mathematics, excellency in ICT enhanced teaching, excellency in primary school leadership, excellency in secondary leadership and a life time achievement award.Portia Naidoo, 47, a teacher at Bernadino Heights High School in Kraaifontein, won the excellency award for physical science.Naidoo said she had gone beyond the call of duty to ensure pupils are the captains of their own ships.The mother-of-two has been described as a positive, honest, highly motivated, responsible and respected person, who is a role model to teachers and pupils.When her name was called, Naidoo said she was &#x201C;surprised, shocked and had &#x2028;butterflies&#x201D;.&#x201C;It felt good. This is a combination of good work. In teaching you don&#x2019;t always get recognised and at the same time you don&#x2019;t go to teaching for the recognition and the money. I am not only a teacher, but a mother and a mentor for all the children.&quot;I always tell my pupils they should not just exist but strive for bigger things, look further and think hard.&#x201D;Marika Smit, 27, awarded the excellency in primary school teaching, said: &#x201C;I am not doing this for myself, but for my pupils.&#x201D;She often visits parents at their homes to remind them of their duty to ensure their children are attending school on a daily basis.She also looks forward to parent meetings to discuss their children&apos;s progress.Education MEC Debbie Sch&#xE4;fer said teachers who work evenings and on weekends not only bettered the lives of their pupils, but also the broader community.&#x201C;This whole of society approach is what is required to take us forward and make a real difference in our province and society.&quot;There are teachers who have used their own initiative and have taken it upon themselves to develop programmes and projects, some who support and mentor other teachers, and others that support and develop learning in various subjects.&#x201D;The other winners include: Miralese Wiegman, Sharone Opperman, Tanya Ernstzen, Stephen Adams, Cecelia &#x2028;Campbell, Dawn Pietersen, Conrad Koegelenberg and Henry Alexander.
