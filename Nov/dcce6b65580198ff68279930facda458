THE head of the Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) of the Health Professionals Council of SA (HPCSA), Joan Adams, has distanced herself from the council&apos;s bungle in declaring Tim Noakes guilty months before final arguments have been heard.On Friday, the HPCSA announced that Noakes was guilty of unprofessional conduct by advising a breastfeeding mother to wean her baby on to a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet.Minutes later they retracted the statement, because the matter has not been finalised.Noakes&#x2019; legal team rested their case on Wednesday and agreement was that the PCC would deliberate in April next year; judgment is expected on April 21.In an extraordinary move, the chairperson, advocate Adams, sent out a statement distancing the committee from the press release, saying it was in the interest of justice to so: &#x201C;This is devoid of all truth&#x2026; The PCC will deliberate in April 2017 after hearing argument.&quot;Noakes&#x2019; legal counsel Adam Pike said yesterday they were writing to the HPCSA asking how it was that the press release had even been written, let alone sent out.
