TWO baby elephants that were among 37 allegedly forcibly removed from their mothers in Zimbabwe&apos;s Hwange National Park &#x2013; and were to be flown to Chinese zoos &#x2013; have died.Zimbabwean animal rights groups said the two animals had died from starvation and thirst due to neglect.The incident comes amid an international outcry over the deaths of a number of baby elephants that died shortly after arriving at their destinations during similar shipments in 2012 and 2015.The Conservation Action Trust said the animal welfare director at Animals Asia had pointed out that there were a possible dozen other zoos earmarked to receive the animals.The organisation said four of the eight baby elephants sent to China in 2012 died before reaching their destination. Three more died shortly after reaching China.Iris Ho, the programme manager for wildlife at Humane Society International, said: &#x201C;In the past elephants sent to Chinese zoos from Zimbabwe have died or languished in deplorable conditions. Sending wild African elephants to zoos in China is either a literal death sentence or akin to life in prison for the animals.&#x201C;If these elephant captures and pending transfers to China are confirmed, there was highly likely diplomatic consideration involved in the Chinese authorities&#x2019; approval of the import.&#x201D;According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), there were about 46&#x2005;000 elephants in Hwange National Park and another 6&#x2005;000 in adjacent communal and safari areas.Elephant biologist doctor Keith Lindsay said: &#x201C;The bigger impact is on elephant behaviour. Taking calves away from the midst of families would be very disruptive and I would not be surprised if the adult females from the affected families were frightened and angry about people on foot or even in vehicles.&#x201D;The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) permits the sale of live elephants only if there&apos;s &#x201C;an export permit or re-export certificate issued by the management authority of the State of export&#x201D; (in Zimbabwe the NSPCA) and may be issued &#x201C;only if the specimen was legally obtained&quot;.
