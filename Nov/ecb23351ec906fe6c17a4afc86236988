Mooi River, KwaZulu-Natal - A driving school operator and an official from the Mooi River driver testing centre are to appear in court on Monday after they were arrested in connection with the fraudulent issuing of motor vehicle driving documents.Road Traffic Management Corporation spokesman Simon Zwane said on Saturday the two were arrested on Friday after months of investigation by the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit.&#x201C;It is alleged that the female driving school operator from Estcourt connived with the male official to have learner licences issued to individuals in exchange for money,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;The two are detained in Durban and will appear in court on Monday.&#x201D;The RTMC warned driving schools to desist from engaging in corrupt activities involving the issuing of licences to unqualified drivers, he said.&#x201C;We have information that many driving schools are involved in these activities and investigations are currently under way to bring the culprits to book. The corrupt issuing of licencing is suspected to be a major contributing factor in the high number of crashes and fatalities in the country.&#x201C;The RTMC has made this a priority as the country approaches the festive season and school holidays. We know that demand for driving document will be high during this period because people have bonuses and young people will be in need of these documents after finishing their schooling careers. More arrests are expected,&#x201D; Zwane said.African News Agency (ANA) Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Subscribe to our Newsletter
