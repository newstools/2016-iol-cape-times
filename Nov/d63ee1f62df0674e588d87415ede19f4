THE Know Your Neighbour &#x2013; Know Your Health fun walk hosted by the Rylands-Gatesville Civic Association through Rylands&#x2019; streets yesterday was &#x201C;a huge success&#x201D;, said the association&apos;s chairperson, Sataar Parker.&#x201C;The motivation for the walk was that there had not been an (active) civic event in this area for a while.&quot;The idea was to bring people of all persuasions together to get to know their neighbours and their state of health,&#x201D; he said.About 550 walkers, who started at 9am from Habibia Primary School in Rylands, were joined at the walk&#x2019;s end by about 3&#x2005;000 cheerleaders for midday lunch.Although the walk comprised of two distances &#x2013; 5km and 2.5km &#x2013; most of the walkers completed the longer distance, said Parker.&#x201C;The three- to five-year-olds&#x2019; distance was the highlight of the event for the parents and grandparents, who were able to see the little ones taking part,&#x201D; he said.Parker said one of the residents won the first prize of a weekend away for two at the Arabella Hotel and Spa in Hermanus, while there were other prizes donated by businesses in the area.There were also a number of stalls &#x2013; including diabetes and cancer stands where people could take their blood pressure and sugar level readings, he added.Among the dignitaries attending the event were Deputy Home Affairs Minister Fatima Chohan and popular local singer Salim Kagee.Parker said the event had been so successful that residents were clamouring for the next one to be held.The Rylands-Gatesville Civic Association is an independent body representing the Rylands Estate and Gatesville community and comprises of residents, businesses and institutions.They work together to improve the quality of life in the area and act as the neighbourhood&apos;s link to local government &#x2013; taking up issues pertaining to physical infrastructure, safety and security, and economic development to help build a stronger, more harmonious community.
