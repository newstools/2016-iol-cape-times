FORMER public protector Thuli Madonsela has defended her decision to speak out on state capture despite completing her term last month, and told President Jacob Zuma to back off from her work.Madonsela, who has joined academia since leaving office last month, told Independent Media on Friday it was not Zuma&apos;s place to tell her what to do with her life.She said she had a duty to talk about the issues raised in public about the work she did for the past seven years.Zuma had told Madonsela to back off from talking &#x2028;publicly about the &quot;State of Capture&quot; report as she had left office.Zuma said it was time for Madonsela to move on with her life and leave the report to follow other processes.Madonsela said it would not be simple to ignore questions raised in the public on the report.&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not the president&apos;s place to tell me what to do, with due respect,&#x201D; she said.&#x201C;I have never heard of judges being told &#x2018;you can&apos;t now use that material&#x2019;. With due respect to the president, &#x2028;I think that is wrong.&#x201D;Madonsela said she was now in academia and would not ignore questions on the report.
