THE State withdrew criminal charges against Robert McBride, the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), and two co-accused on Monday.This comes after prosecutors told the court that witnesses were intimidated.The charges against McBride and Ipid colleagues Matthew Sesoko and Innocent Khuba relate to the alleged amending of a report into illegal deportation of Zimbabwean murder suspects in 2010.It was alleged that this had been done to absolve the former head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks), Anwa Dramat, of wrongdoing.Prosecutors withdrew the charges after telling the Pretoria Magistrate&#x2019;s Court that witnesses were reluctant to testify and consult during the court&#x2019;s lunch break with Torie Pretorius, the head of the National Prosecuting Authority&#x2019;s Priority Crimes Litigation Unit.McBride recently returned to his post as head of Ipid after the Constitutional Court set aside his suspension in September by Police Minister Nathi Nhleko, ruling that it was invalid.
