A local NGO is one of 20 to be recognised globally for its efforts to empower girls.Rock Girl won the With and For Girls Award in London, and scooped R200 000 towards its cause.The organisation was competing against 161 other organisations from 17 countries.The awards, hosted in the UK, are a global initiative to identify and support organisations working with, and for, girls.Rock Girl in Cape Town has &#x2028;75 members from 14 different schools, including Khayelitsha, Gugulethu, Manenberg, Elsie&#x2019;s River, Rylands, Pinelands, Bonteheuwel and Woodstock.Rock Girl was invited to apply for the award in January based on its work, which includes empowering young girls through motivational talks and career training.Founder India Baird, who left for London last night to receive the award, said she hoped it would highlight and help break the cycle of violence in various communities.Baird said they had dedicated the award to families of rape and murder survivors and victims.&#x201C;This award inspires Rock Girl to continue our efforts to make South Africa safer for all.&#x201C;Rock Girl believes that girls matter, and that there is a dire need for a sea change in the way society &#x2013; in particular South African society &#x2013; treats its girls.&#x201C;Girls are often viewed as the most vulnerable members of a community, but Rock Girl is changing that perspective. Girls who are part of Rock Girl are modern-day adventurers, explorers, activists and authors &#x2013; telling their own stories and laying a strong foundation for their own futures,&#x201D; said Baird.Miche Williams, a Rock Girl from Manenberg, said: &#x201C;We are creating a sisterhood, one that supports girls in our community, but also advocates for girls in the city, in our country and across the continent.&#x201D;In Manenberg children witness the horrors of violence and daylight shootings on a daily basis.Chances are high that the children will join gangs or become victims of gang violence when they are teenagersLee-Anne Jenkins, 15, said Rock Girl had changed her life for the better.&#x201C;The power of working besides other girls to create lasting change is something I&#x2019;ve never experienced anywhere else and I know that together we can make a lasting impact on other girls&#x2019; lives.&#x201D;Muna Wehbe, chief executive for the Stars Foundation, which administers the awards, said this year&#x2019;s awards recipients demonstrated the power of grassroots movements and the leadership of girls to effect change.&#x201C;We want to encourage more funders to trust and invest in girls to address the challenges they face in their everyday life,&#x201D; said Wehbe.
