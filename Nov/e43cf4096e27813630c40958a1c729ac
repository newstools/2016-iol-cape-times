DISBELIEF and shock were on the faces of American nationals at the Taj Hotel in the city after Donald Trump&apos;s presidency was announced yesterday.The US Consul-General Teddy Taylor had hosted an election results gathering, decorated with the red, &#x2028;white and blue, miniature American flags, campaign buttons and cut-outs of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for photo ops.At the event, Taylor and US nationals were joined by foreign diplomats, including the French and British consuls-general, to witness history being made.Taylor said it was a celebration of the democratic process.&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just a regular person and have not spoken to family or friends, and hearing as events unfold as anybody else. Regardless of the outcome, the American people will come together and we will move forward,&#x201D; said Taylor.He thanked those in attendance, and while he did not give the tally of votes made by US citizens in the province, he confirmed the majority were in favour of Clinton.When news broke of Clinton conceding the presidency and congratulating Trump, the look of disbelief on the faces was entrenched on some of the faces.More so when Trump was introduced as the next American president at his Republican rally.President Jacob Zuma congratulated Trump on his election victory.In a statement, Zuma conveyed his best wishes on behalf of the government and the people of South Africa after Trump saw off the challenge of Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House.Zuma said he &#x201C;looked forward to working with President-elect Trump to build on the strong relations that &#x2028;exist between the two countries&#x201D;.He said South Africa looked forward to working closely with the new administration in the US in promoting peace, security and prosperity around the world, especially on the African continent.Atlanta, Georgia native Kathryn Hoeflich said she was in disbelief but could not imagine the outcome.&#x201C;This is actually really happening not just to the country I came from and still love, but to the world. This election just showed how deeply unsatisfied the American public is with the government. It&#x2019;s sad,&#x201D; said Hoeflich.Another US national, Will Hanovite, said the situation &#x2028;in the States was not too dissimilar to the situation in South Africa.&#x201C;The States is facing this huge difficulty where a large fraction feels disenfranchised and disrespected. When you have one person one vote, this is the result of the election,&#x201D; said Hanovite.He said the US would survive with the government or in spite of it.
