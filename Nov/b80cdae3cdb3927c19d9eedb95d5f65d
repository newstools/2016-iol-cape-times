STUDENTS from Stellenbosch University, UWC, UCT and CPUT gathered at a #FeesMustFall protest at Stellenbosch University on Wednesday in an attempt shut down the institution.Just before the start of afternoon exams, the group of about 70 moved towards the Education Building and tried to gain access to disrupt exams in progress. They were, however, blocked by Public Order Police and security personnel.The group remained in front of the building for a large part of the afternoon as police Nyalas stood ready nearby.Stellenbosch University #FeesMustFall member Gabriella Oliver said: The purpose of today s protest was to shut down and disrupt whiteness.&quot;We are here to decolonise this space, and we are here to demand our right to free, decolonised education. Stellenbosch operates in isolation it's like a country on its own. We cannot entertain white supremacy in a democratic country.&quot;&quot;Our cause is noble, we are unarmed students, we do not have guns or bombs. We are just here asking for support from students from Stellenbosch to assist us in our plea,&quot; she said.UWC student leader Azania Tyhali said black students were the minority at the institution and bore the brunt of excessive fees.&quot;Stellenbosch needs to shut down like other universities that have shut down, simply because black children at the institution are suffering. We have had enough of our black parents having to pay exorbitant amounts in fees.&quot;Stellenbosch University spokesperson Martin Viljoen said the institution was committed to completing its academic year.&quot;Information available to the university is that the largest part of the group were not from Stellenbosch University but from other universities in the Western Cape,&quot; Viljoen said.According to him, a small number of students who were to write exams in the building were not able to access the building before it had to be locked.&quot;No further disruptions took place this afternoon, but the university's contingency plans and security measures will remain in place for the duration of the exams. The situation on campus is closely monitored,&quot; Viljoen said.The university has made counsellors available to students who are in need of support.
