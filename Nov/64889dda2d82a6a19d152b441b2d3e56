ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has been accused of being the ringleader of a &#x201C;regime change agenda&#x201D; within the &#x2028;former liberation movement &#x2028;as the fight between the ANC and its embattled Western Cape leader, Marius Fransman, continues.The ANC slapped Fransman with a five-year ban last week, which he is studying and intends to appeal, following allegations of sexual harassment against him.He has ridiculed the disciplinary process that found him guilty, saying it was driven by a factional agenda and was challenging its outcome.Yesterday, Fransman accused the ANC&#x2019;s national disciplinary committee of applying double standards in his case, saying it had failed to sanction Mantashe when allegations of sexual harassment were reported against him last year.At the time, Mantashe dismissed the allegations as &#x2028;nothing but a smear campaign.&#x201C;The disciplinary process must not have eyes. It must not be selective by having one set of rules for one individual and another for others,&#x201D; said Fransman.&#x201C;Was Mantashe not supposed to appear before a disciplinary committee? He holds a high office.&#x201C;He pushed an agenda against Fransman but is not prepared to face the music (himself),&#x201D; lamented Fransman, who described the allegations he faced as a political ploy to tarnish him.When asked why he felt Mantashe was targeting him, Fransman said: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s very clear that comrade Mantashe understands that I don&#x2019;t support the regime change agenda (that he is pushing for), that says we should create anarchy to get positions in the ANC.&#x201D;He said he had spoken out about secret plans from within the ruling party to remove President Jacob Zuma from power.The party is set to elect a new leadership in December next year. It has fended off sustained calls for Zuma to step down because of the many scandals associated with his leadership of the government and the party.Some of Zuma&#x2019;s cabinet ministers, ANC structures (including party veterans), the business sector, civil society and opposition parties have spoken out against Zuma&#x2019;s leadership and called on him to resign.Zuma has also survived numerous votes of no confidence brought against him by the opposition in the National Assembly.Fransman said: &#x201C;The instability that we see today is what I call the enemy within the ANC that is fighting for its narrow political interests.&#x201D;He accused the party&#x2019;s national disciplinary committee (NDC) of having been captured by a faction led by Mantashe. The NDC, said Fransman, had lied to the country when &#x2028;it said he had received all &#x2028;documentation from it to help him prepare for the hearing.&#x201C;I reject the finding of my disciplinary hearing (as) the expected outcome was predetermined from the outset.&#x201C;I was denied access to &#x2028;relevant documentation, even in the face of a high court order. ANC SG (secretary-&#x2028;general) Gwede Mantashe is in contempt for ignoring a high court order to release &#x2028;all relevant documentation &#x2028;to me. The NDC is lying about having provided all relevant documentation and I demand an apology,&#x201D; Fransman said.&#x201C;I reserve all my rights. We are studying the finding and will certainly appeal.&#x201D;When contacted for comment, Mantashe said: &#x201C;I respect the processes of the ANC. Fransman has got a right to appeal to the national disciplinary committee of appeal.&#x201C;Now, he is using &#x200B;(Independent Media) as an appeal process and wants to call me as a witness, I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201D;
