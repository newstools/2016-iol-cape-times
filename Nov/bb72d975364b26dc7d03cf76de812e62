Suspended ANC provincial chairperson Marius Fransman said the case against him could be prejudiced by &#x201C;certain individuals&#x201D; as he fights for his political survival.Fransman said on Monday the ANC&#x2019;s integrity committee process, which probed him over a sexual harassment complaint filed by a 21-year-old Stellenbosch woman, was flawed.The woman accompanied Fransman and two other men to the ANC&#x2019;s birthday celebrations in Rustenburg in January, but complained to the police Fransman allegedly sexually harassed her. The incidents allegedly took place in the car they were travelling in and at a hotel in Kimberley.But Fransman insisted he was innocent. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s now time for the ANC, (secretary-general Gwede) Mantashe and others to admit they were wrong to use the integrity committee process to get rid of me,&#x201D; said Fransman.He accused the integrity committee&#x2019;s note-taker, Krish Naidoo, of giving &#x201C;false information&#x201D; to the media about having handed over all the relevant documentation.Fransman said he and his legal team on September 22 requested information, along with the minutes of the integrity committee, addendums, and the minutes of the ANC&#x2019;s national working committee meeting, which had received the committee&#x2019;s report.&#x201C;But we got nothing. Instead, all we got were the articles which had appeared in the press.&#x201C;I demand that the ANC&#x2019;s national executive committee nullify the integrity committee process. There&#x2019;s no way that can go to a disciplinary committee (hearing) without receiving the documents.&#x201D;The hearing will sit on Thursday and Friday at an undisclosed location.At the Cosatu May Day rally, the chairperson of the ANC&#x2019;s national disciplinary committee, Derek Hanekom, without directly referring to Fransman, said &#x201C;we cannot have sexual harassment (in our movement)&#x201D;.He has since recused himself from Fransman&#x2019;s disciplinary inquiry and in his absence Lindiwe Sisulu will chair the committee.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the party would not discuss the case, including Fransman&#x2019;s observations outside of the hearing.&#x201C;If he&#x2019;s got any comment to make, he should make it inside the hearing.&#x201D;
