HUMANITARIAN Imtiaz Sooliman says being honoured with the Global Citizen Award helps build faith and confidence in others to support African NGOs and their work in the future.The Gift of the Givers founder accepted the honour at a ceremony in London&#x2028;at the weekend and dedicated it to Africa.&#x201C;This is a wonderful opportunity to showcase the continent and all that we can do. Being honoured with a prestigious award like this means we have the global stamp of approval which helps build faith and confidence in others to support African NGOs and our work in the future,&#x201D; Sooliman said.He was awarded by advisory firm Henley &amp; Partners in London on Friday, which also marked the closing of the 10th annual Global Residence and Citizenship Conference.The annual laureate of the Global Citizen Award is chosen by an independent award committee of &#x2028;world leaders through a majority decision.The Gift of the Givers has raised about R2 billion for 42 countries around the world, including war-ravaged states such as Syria and Somalia.Henley &amp; Partners group chairperson Christian K&#xE4;lin praised Sooliman&#x2019;s courage and commitment.&#x201C;Dr Sooliman is an exceptionally worthy recipient of the award as his work is not only visionary but innovative in many ways,&#x201D; said K&#xE4;lin.Last week, Gawa Sayed, a member of Gift of the Givers, received the Desmond &amp; Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation&#x2019;s Unsung Heroes Award.
