The so-called killer rats which caused the deaths of two inmates in 2015 might have been cleared, but authorities at Pollsmoor Prison are still battling chronic overcrowding.Over 8&#x2005;900 inmates are squashed into a facility built to accommodate 3&#x2005;900.Last week, a delegation from the Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services, along with members of the NCOP&#x2019;s select committee on security and justice, visited the prison to get an update.This after former Correctional Services Inspecting Judge Edwin Cameron wrote a damning report on conditions.Accompanying the MPs was Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Michael Masutha, and his deputy Thabang Makwetla, along with Department of Correctional Services commissioner Zach Modise, and provincial commissioner Delekile Klaas.The delegation were first taken to Pollsmoor&#x2019;s remand detention facility where awaiting trial prisoners are kept.Prison officials told the delegation some prisoners have been awaiting trial for as long as eight years.&#x201C;We have three at Khayelitsha (Magistrate&#x2019;s Court), we have one at Blue Downs and we have two at Wynberg that have been incarcerated for more than eight years,&#x201D; said one official.Those arrested and transferred to Pollsmoor start off life inside the prison walls at one of four special caged pens.They are branded with the names of different areas across the Cape Flats, where most of those arrested come from, names such as Mitchells Plain, Khayelitsha and Blue Downs.Shown around the remand facility&#x2019;s laundry room, the DA&#x2019;s George Michalakis questioned the frequency with which prison blankets were washed.One of the machines broke down months ago and a replacement part has still to be imported.On the day of the visit, MPs were told the remand detention facility housed 638 inmates, who are charged with murder, 796 for aggravated robbery, 304 for rape, and 338 for drug trafficking.At Pollsmoor&#x2019;s female section, the visiting politicians and department officials were told that there were 692 inmates, 341 awaiting trial with only 392 beds between all those behind bars.Many females either end up sleeping on the floor, or next to a fellow prisoner.Michalakis said the visit to Pollsmoor was extremely shocking.&#x201C;What was most shocking is when the regional commissioner spoke about similar conditions at other prisons, he was smacked down by the national commissioner for criticising government.&#x201D;He said instead of arresting people and dispatching them to Pollsmoor, police had to work on their crime prevention strategies.Makwetla said while he was satisfied conditions had improved for those locked up, the overcrowding remained a serious concern for the &#x2028;ministry.While it had not been raised during the visit, the NCOP&#x2019;s select committee on security and justice, chairperson Dumisani Ximbi, said Department of Correctional Services would have to answer questions about its administration, and deputy regional commissioner Freddie Engelbrecht&#x2019;s visit to a UN meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, as part of a Solidarity delegation which challenged the department&#x2019;s employment equity policy.
