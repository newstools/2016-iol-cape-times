THE local, provincial and national governments are set to put their differences aside, pool their resources and help the people displaced by floods.This is in the wake of the flash floods that hit Setswetla informal settlement in Alexandra, Johannesburg, and other parts of Gauteng.President Jacob Zuma made the remark yesterday during his visit to the impoverished settlement, where he met Shadrick Chauke, the father of three-year-old Everite, who was swept away by the floods last week.The president was accompanied by Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen.Zuma said Makhura told him a total of 4&#x2005;900 people had been affected by the floods across the province.Zuma told Chauke what happened was &#x201C;very painful&#x201D; and they sympathised with him. He thanked humanitarian aid group Gift of the &#x2028;Givers for their swift response to the crisis.Zuma said immediate plans had been put in place to help those most affected, and this included the setting up of temporary structures for the displace.He called on those affected to co-operate with authorities, saying the long-term plan was to ultimately control the flow of the Jukskei River to ensure such a disaster did not occur again.&#x201C;As government we are going to pool resources together to make sure such a tragedy doesn&#x2019;t repeat itself,&#x201D; said Zuma.Screams of &#x201C;my president&#x201D;, &#x201C;Zuma&#x201D; and &#x201C;Gedleyihlekisa&#x201D; were heard as Zuma and his heavily armed guards arrived an hour late at the settlement.An Economic Freedom Fighters supporter, wearing the party&#x2019;s red colours, shouted from the bridge overlooking the settlement: &#x201C;Zuma, you must fall!&#x201D;The president has had numerous calls from within the ANC, opposition parties, civil society and the business sector to step down.This was because of his scandal-prone leadership of the former liberation movement and Africa&#x2019;s largest economy.He has also ducked many no confidence motions laid against him by opposition parties in the National Assembly.The scandals associated with Zuma&#x2019;s leadership include the firing of Nhlanhla Nene &#x2028;as finance minister, which sent the rand into a tailspin; his disregard for the constitution over the Nkandla upgrades; &#x2028;the fraud charges against current Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, which were later dropped; and the explosive investigation into state capture by Zuma&#x2019;s close friends, the Guptas.Yesterday, DA leader Mmusi Maimane opened corruption charges against Zuma and &#x201C;his band of cronies&#x201D; at the Rosebank police station for their role in &#x201C;aiding, promoting and benefiting from the corrosive project of state capture in South Africa&#x201D;.
