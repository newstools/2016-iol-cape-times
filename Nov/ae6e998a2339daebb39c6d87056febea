Community Policing Forums (CPFs) have hailed the Department of Transport and Hawks&#x2019; bust of R5.3 million cash, ID documents and two vehicles as a deterrent to underworld syndicates.A joint Hawks and Department of Transport investigation has led to the arrest on Sunday of a 33-year-old suspect alleged to be running an illicit licensing and police clearance operation in Belhar.Nyanga CPF member Zwelibanzi Velebhayi said: &#x201C;What a breakthrough. This is a huge bust. I would not be surprised if this is a big syndicate. Well done to the law enforcement.&#x201D;Bellville South CPF member Jason Hendricks said there have been complaints that vehicles were being cleared.&#x201C;Not even once had I imagined this illegal activity was taking place in my neighbourhood. I would like to encourage the community to report suspicious activities.&#x201D;He said he would not be surprised if the alleged syndicate has connections in other countries.&#x201C;Its not possible that a few criminals with no outside connections can keep R5.3 million in the house. It is very rare for local criminals to keep IDs with them. Otherwise if IDs were used to help the locals to clear their cars that means there will be more arrests outside the syndicate,&#x201D; said Hendricks.Hawks spokesperson Lloyd Ramvha said: &#x201C;The suspect, who was allegedly running an illicit licensing and police clearance operation was arrested by the Unit&#x2019;s Anti-Corruption members at his home in Belhar on Sunday. Almost R5.3 million in cash, several ID documents as well as two vehicles were seized during the search and seizure operation,&#x201D; he said.Hawks acting provincial head Mzwandile Ndlovu, praised the members for the arrest.&#x201C;This is undoubtedly a telling blow to the underworld,&#x201D; he said.The suspect is expected to appear in the Bellville Magistrate&#x2019;s Court ton Tuesday.
