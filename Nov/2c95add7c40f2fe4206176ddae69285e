ITS financial loss of R5.6 billion in two years will be in the spotlight when South African Airways lands in Parliament this week.The national carrier has been struggling the past few years, and it only recently got a new board after approval by the cabinet.The National Treasury has been saying the airline needed a strong board to turn it around.But concerns have been raised in Parliament about the losses incurred by the airline over the past two years.For that period, SAA did not submit audited financial statements to Parliament as it needed a guarantee of R5bn to continue as a going concern.The Treasury would not approve the guarantee until there was a new board.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan had called for a new board with the right skills and qualifications.SAA will have to report to MPs on progress made in the past few months since the new board was appointed.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said last week they were improving the performance of state-owned enterprises.Ramaphosa is heading an interministerial committee looking into the matter.
