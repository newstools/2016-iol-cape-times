THE Cape Town City Ballet (CTCB) says it faces a possible shutdown when its lease with UCT expires on December&nbsp;31.The dancers say they were forced to vacate UCT after threats and intimidation, allegedly by protesting students. They are being housed at the Artscape Theatre Centre until they finish their three productions, which are scheduled to end in January. The CTCB consists of 43&nbsp;members.CTCB executive director Elizabeth Triegaardt said: If we don t find space in January, we will close down because there will be no offices. Triegaardt and two of her administration staff are now working from home. The rest of the dancers are using a studio with no changing rooms at the back of the Artscape Theatre Centre.Triegaardt said the lack of space had led her to suspend the young male dancers development programme, in which several black dancers were flourishing.Triegaardt said it was made clear to us that we should not go to UCT during protests last month. We do not feel safe at all. I am sad that 82 years have to come to an end in this fashion. Artscape Theatre Centre chief executive Marlene le Roux said the reason for the provision of space to the CTCB was because it had an upcoming season at the centre. Together with the City and the provincial government, we need to find the best possible solution, said Le Roux.UCT spokesperson Pat Lucas said: The School of Dance did have to be closed for a day due to disruptions by protesters who were walking from one UCT building to the next. They were not targeting CTCB, but were seeking to shut down all operations on campus as part of a nationwide protest. She added the lease has been under discussion since 2014 as UCT was taking in larger numbers in dance courses.
