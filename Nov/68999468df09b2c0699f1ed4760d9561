UNIVERSITIES, which claim to support free education should send the bill to Blade and Pravin to prove they believe in the students plight.UCT academic Dr Lydia Cairncross expressed this sentiment last night while speaking at a dialogue session and panel discussion convened by the National Association of Democratic Lawyers (Nadel) and the Human Rights Foundation.Cairncross, who is also a member of staff for social justice in education, joined students, advocates, the EFF s Dali Mpofu, UCT vice-chancellor Max Price to debate the crises in tertiary education last night.Nadel represented student activists in recent court matters related to protests. Western Cape High Court judge Siraj Desai chaired the meeting at the Homecoming Centre in the CBD. Cairncross said, Take the bill up to Blade (Nzimande) and Pravin (Ghordan) and then we can see our universities are with us. She said while universities claimed they believed in this idea they could not exclude students. That won t work, it must end right now, move the bill upward. Caincross had spoken after Price, who said he believed in a financial model, where the rich paid, the poor got education for free and those in the middle could get funding. Fees Must Fall (FMF) leader Sinoxolo Mbali pointed out the FMF protests had not started at white universities . He said it had started at black universities but the country came to a halt when white universities burnt. Mbali said protests were about fees and about inequality.
