AFTER weeks of protest and disruptions threatened to derail UCT s academic year, an agreement has finally been reached between its executive and student activists.Talks were held at the weekend between the university executive and student leadership as the exams began this week.This follows weeks of disruptions which resulted in property damage, clashes with private security and the arrest of students, including Atabile Nonxuba and Masixole Mlandu.Fearing continued unrest, the university reverted to alternative methods of instruction described as blended learning .UCT applied, and was granted an interim court interdict which prohibits disruption of exams, libraries, research and other laboratories, and the ability of any of the university's employees to do their work.The agreement states the university believes there is sufficient common ground to reach an agreement on a set of principles to break the deadlock and move the university forward in the best interests of all.This agreement was signed by vice-chancellor Max Price, the student leadership and mediators.Student activist Simon Rakei said it had been a learning curve as compromises were made. There was a bit of anger and distrust after continuous collapse of negotiations, and the vice-chancellor and executive negotiating in bad faith. But to secure gains, we continued, said Rakei.He said other issues would be addressed by a Rapid Response Task Team consisting of Price, key student leaders and other stakeholders. There is obvious concern surrounding our cadres facing criminal charges, even though the university has agreed on clemency. UCT spokesperson Gerda Kruger said: We believe it's a step in the right direction for creating sustainable change in the future. We are committed to respecting the process of engagement and to carving out solutions to the challenges we face, and the differences we have, in as inclusive a manner as possible. There remains a great deal of work to be done. [email&#160;protected]
