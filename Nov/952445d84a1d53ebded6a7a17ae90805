A DOCUMENTARY which compared the conditions of farmworkers to slavery and exposed farm owners' use of the dop system has raised the ire of the Western Cape government.Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde vowed to root out and take a hard line against farmworker abuse within the wine industry. Danish investigative journalist Tom Heinemann s documentary, Bitter Grapes Slavery in the vineyards, exposed the exploitative working conditions of farmworkers. Winde said: There are employees in our economy who receive very poor treatment. This was never ever acceptable, and it still isn t. It will not be tolerated.&quot; He said farmers were given 60 days to take corrective action, and 14 days to rectify the most critical failures. The Commercial, Stevedoring, Agricultural and Allied Workers Union welcomed the issuing of labour practice contravention notices . Robinson Winery farmworkers recently protested for an increase in wages and better working conditions. Strike committee spokesperson Denico Dube said: The strike continues due to the company s refusal to sign a peace clause agreeing not to pursue disciplinary action against those involved to backdate a pay increase to May this year and to pay workers their usual Christmas bonus. Robertson Winery s human resources manager, Reinette Jordaan, said the only way for the strike to end is for workers to accept their offer.
