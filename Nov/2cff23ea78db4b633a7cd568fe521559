WHILE the police are still searching for city attorney Noorudien Hassan&#x2019;s killers, anti-crime group People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) is rejoicing at his murder.Hassan, 45, was killedw when gunmen approached him while he was outside his Lansdowne house on Monday night, and opened fire.Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said there were no new developments yesterday.Pagad national co-ordinator and spokesperson Haroon Orrie said Hassan was a target because he had defended a number of gangsters in court.Hassan had been the defence attorney in a number of high-profile cases, including of Irshaad Laher and alleged 28s gang boss Ralph Stanfield, both accused in matters involving illegal guns.He represented Jerome &#x201C;Donkie&#x201D; Booysen, who was named as the head of the &#x2028;Sexy Boys gang during a &#x2028;court case.Hassan also represented Sotheby&#x2019;s International Realty SA chief executive Jason Rohde, accused of murdering his wife.Orrie said yesterday that Pagad was not responsible for the murder, but it was not sympathetic.&#x201C;Children are being raped and killed every day because of gangsters; we can put the blame on them. Then we have Noorudien, who feels it is OK to defend these individuals.&#x201C;There are some rumours from expelled Pagad members who have said Pagad is behind the murders, but there is no factual evidence to back this,&#x201D; Orrie said.Hassan&#x2019;s sister Haseema previously said the family would not be drawn into speculation about whether her brother&#x2019;s murder was related to his work.Anyone with information about the incident may contact Lansdowne detectives on 021&#xA0;700&#xA0;9000 or 082&#xA0;576&#xA0;2804, Crime Stop on 08600&#xA0;10111 or SMS Crimeline 32211.
